3-O Ethyl Ascorbic Acid,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Dark Spot Fading","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Dark Spot Fading, Antioxidant",A more stable derivative of pure vitamin C | Capable of helping fade dark spots | Has water- and oil-soluble properties | Offers anti-aging benefits on par with vitamin C,"3-O ethyl ascorbic acid is a stable, water- and oil-soluble derivative of pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) that offers all of the primary benefits vitamin C is known for, such as brightening, wrinkle reduction, visible firming, fading hyperpigmentation to restore a more even skin tone and offsetting numerous triggers of environmental damage. As a modified and more stable version of pure vitamin C, 3-O ethyl ascorbic acid must be converted to vitamin C within skin by sodium-dependent proteins. This process within skin’s surface layers helps ensure skin benefits. Due to the conversion to pure vitamin C being a slower process, 3-O ethyl ascorbic acid is considered a more tolerable form of vitamin C. However, like pure vitamin C, the ethyl form requires an acidic pH range (4–5.5) for optimum stability. This pH range is higher than what ascorbic acid needs for ideal stability, making 3-O ethyl ascorbic acid an intriguing alternative if your skin hasn’t been able to tolerate higher-strength (10% and up) vitamin C (ascorbic acid) products. Research has shown which non-irritating ingredients aid the penetration of this ingredient into skin’s surface, and they include pentylene glycol, glycerin, 1,2 hexanediol, diisostearyl malate and various propylene glycol derivatives, although this list is not exhaustive. Usage levels of 3-O ethyl ascorbic acid in skin care typically fall between 0.5–5%. Due to its stability, lesser amounts are needed compared with pure vitamin C. Levels above 5% may also be used, depending on desired benefits. Amounts up to 30% have been shown to be non-irritating on human skin samples."

Acetyl Dipeptide-1 Cetyl Ester,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Lab-made anti-aging peptide that promotes firmer skin | Bio-identical to a skin-natural peptide that aids elasticity | Used as part of a blend with butylene glycol and hydroxyethylcellulose | Soothing effect offsets stinging and burning sensations on skin,"Acetyl dipeptide-1 cetyl ester is a lab-engineered synthetic peptide that combines acetic acid and cetyl alcohol with dipeptide-1, a peptide composed of amino acids arginine and tyrosine. Dipeptide-1 is found naturally in the body and plays a role in maintaining skin’s elasticity. Research has shown that topical application of this peptide protects collagen-making cells known as fibroblasts from the visible impact of glycation, a process in which destructive sugar molecules progressively weaken skin’s supportive elements. This ingredient has also been shown to thwart irritation on skin’s surface that would otherwise result in stinging or burning sensations. As such, it’s a very good option to pair with bio-active ingredients that can be more sensitizing for some people. Recommended usage levels of this peptide range from 3–4%; however, since the peptide portion itself is part of a blend, the actual amount of peptide needed to gain benefit is much lower, in the parts per million level. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics."
Acetyl Glucosamine,Best,"Hydration, Soothing, Evens Skin Tone","Hydration, Soothing, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant, Humectant",Multi-purpose antioxidant | Plays a role in improving discolorations | Offers skin-calming properties | Helps skin make its own hyaluronic acid,"Acetyl glucosamine is a multi-purpose antioxidant that has been shown to be effective in reducing visible discolorations (specifically in 2-5% concentration). It works particularly well for evening skin tone when paired with the B vitamin niacinamide. It can also help reinforce skin’s supportive elements and is known to be soothing. One of the uniquely beneficial aspects of acetyl glucosamine is that it is a precursor of hyaluronic acid (meaning it helps skin produce its own hyaluronic acid content naturally). Hyaluronic acid is a fundamental component responsible for helping skin maintain hydration and elasticity. Technically speaking, acetyl glucosamine is an amino-monosaccharide (simple sugar). Although pure acetyl glucosamine is considered more sensitive to stability issues, research shows a synthetic or bio-fermented derivative known as n-acetyl glucosamine has been proven to be more stable and highly effective. This is the type you’ll find in the Paula’s Choice Skincare 10% and 20% niacinamide treatments and RESIST eye cream. This form is also vegan (whereas pure acetyl glucosamine is typically derived from shellfish). FYI: Following the correct INCI (International Nomenclature Cosmetic Ingredient) naming conventions n-acetyl glucosamine simply goes by acetyl glucosamine on ingredient lists, but you can always consult the brand to find out which form they are using. The July 2022 safety assessment of acetyl glucosamine conducted by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded this ingredient is safe for cosmetic use. Their report showed acetyl glucosamine can be used in leave-on products in up to 8% concentration without issue when formulated to be non-irritating."

It helps skin better defend itself from environmental aggressors by virtue of a calming effect. This peptide can also help promote a visibly more even skin tone by playing a role in how melanin moves through skin."
Acetyl Hexapeptide-37,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Peptides, Humectant","Synthetic peptide | Composed of amino acids (alanine, proline, serine, and glycine) | Works with water channels in skin’s surface layers | Helps provide balanced hydration between skin’s layers","Acetyl hexapeptide-37 is a synthetic peptide composed of the amino acids alanine, proline, serine and glycine. This peptide works with the water channels (known as aquaporins) in skin’s surface layers, helping to provide adequate, balanced hydration between skin’s layers, a process which alleviates signs of dry, dehydrated skin. Although there isn’t independent research confirming the effectiveness of this peptide on skin, the supplier (Lipotec) has made the results of their research available in a lengthy technical report that’s supported by third-party studies. Between this information and the wider field of published scientific research on peptides for skin, we feel confident recommending acetyl hexapeptide-37, particularly for dehydrated skin."
Acetyl Hexapeptide-8,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Peptides, Humectant",Also known as agireline and acetyl hexpeptide-3 | Synthetically derived | Has water-binding abilities and skin-restoring properties | Is considered a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide,"Acetyl hexapeptide-8 is a synthetic peptide that is primarily used in skin care products. Formerly known by its original trade name Argireline and generically as acetyl hexapeptide-3, it has water-binding properties and skin-restoring abilities that play roles in helping skin look and feel younger. Acetyl hexapeptide-8 is a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide, meaning it works within skin’s surface layers to interrupt the look of expression lines; however, its efficacy in this regard doesn’t replace in-office wrinkle-smoothing injectable procedures. Interestingly, research from suppliers has shown this peptide also helps support skin’s collagen and preserve a firmer appearance. Studies have shown this peptide can penetrate further into skin and delivery greater efficacy for smoothing expression lines if specific formulary steps are followed, including accounting for the type of emulsion (a higher water content allows greater penetration). As always, this demonstrates the importance of selecting well-formulated skin care products to add to your routine. Acetyl hexapeptide-8 may also be referred to as acetyl hexapeptide-8 amide."
Acetyl sh-Hexapeptide-5 Amide Acetate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Helps reinforce skin’s firmness and resilience | Topical use helps improves skin’s tautness | Considered gentle on skin | Synthetic peptide based on the binding and anchoring protein fibronectin,"Acetyl sh-hexapeptide-5 amide acetate is a synthetic peptide made to be bioidentical to the portion of the fibronectin molecule (a skin-binding and anchoring protein) that contains the amino acids arginine, aspartic acid, proline, and serine. It is also simply called hexapeptide-5. This peptide plays a role in reinforcing skin’s surface resilience, tautness and smoothness, leading to improved tensile strength and a more lifted, firmer appearance. Another benefit of this peptide is that it’s capable of binding water to skin’s surface, offering a hyaluronic acid-like effect on helping skin maintain balanced hydration. Acetyl sh-hexapeptide-5 amide acetate is supplied as a solution with a recommended usage level of 1–3% in skin care formulas. This translates to the peptide level being between 0.04–0.06%, which is why you may see this listed toward the end of a skin care product’s ingredient list. Although an independent safety assessment of this peptide hasn’t been done, validated testing from the supplier has shown it to be non-irritating and non-sensitizing."

Its calming properties are believed to reduce undereye puffiness due to fluid accumulation, such as from allergies (which is not the same as undereye bags that occur from fat pads beneath the skin slipping out of place).This peptide is also believed to interrupt a process in skin known as glycation, which can cause skin’s supportive elements to weaken, giving way to wrinkles and loss of firmness. Acetyl tetrapeptide-5 seems to step in and help skin maintain a smooth resilience that results in a more youthful look."
Acetyl Tetrapeptide-9,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides, Humectant",“Signal peptide” with anti-aging benefits | Supports skin’s firmness and elasticity | Touted for hydrating/plumping effects | Lab-engineered (synthetic),"Acetyl tetrapeptide-9 is a “signal peptide” used in skin care for its anti-aging benefits. It works by supporting key skin components like collagen, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), and lumican, which are essential for maintaining skin structure and elasticity. Studies indicate topical application improves skin density and firmness, for a smoother, more taut appearance. This peptide is also touted for its hydrating and plumping effects. It is lab-engineered through a process known as acetylation (a chemical reaction that involves transforming tetrapeptide-9 into an effective agent for skin). Tetrapeptide-9 is composed of the amino acids aspartic acid, glutamine, histidine and valine. Acetyl tetrapeptide-9 may be found in skin care products under trade names such as Dermican®, Replexium®, and Cosroma® AT-9. The recommended use level ranges from 0.0015%–0.0025% when supplied as a powder, and 1.3–2.1% when supplied in a liquid blend (which equates to the recommended concentration range of the powder form).

Acetyl Zingerone,Best,,"Antioxidant, Plant Extracts, Chelating Agent","Potent, ginger-derived antioxidant | Helps offset numerous visible signs of environmental damage | Very good stability in the presence of UV light | Plays a role in protecting skin from airborne pollutants","Acetyl zingerone is a ginger-derived antioxidant that served as an “omni-antioxidant” because it’s able to scavenge and neutralize a broad range of free radicals known to impair skin’s health and appearance. Research on human skin and skin cells has shown acetyl zingerone helps offset the negative impacts of environmental damage, helps visibly repair, and nurtures skin’s ability to maintain the integrity of the extracellular matrix for a healthy appearance. It’s particularly good at soothing UV-exposed skin, interrupting the cascade of damage it causes on and within skin’s surface layers. This antioxidant has excellent photostability (remains stable for longer when exposed to UV light) and also plays a role in diminishing mottled pigmentation due to exposures across the visible light spectrum, meaning it helps protect skin from visible (blue or HEV) light exposure. Acetyl zingerone also delivers anti-pollution benefits, including from “urban dust” (small particulate matter that often contains collagen-degrading heavy metals). It also helps interrupt the damage certain enzymes in skin can cause to our collagen, thus preserving a youthful look for longer and helping to reduce lines and wrinkles. Usage levels in cosmetics range from 0.5¬–1% if the primary goal is antioxidant benefit. Acetyl zingerone is also a chelating agent when used at level of 0.1–0.2%. Note that despite being ginger-derived, this ingredient is considered synthetic since its molecular structure incorporates elements from a compound in ginger known as zingerone and the plant-derived soothing agent curcumin. Essentially, it’s a lab-designed antioxidant that offers more potency and stability than what’s found in the ginger plant."
Achillea Millefolium Extract,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Has antioxidant properties | Can rejuvenate skin’s surface | Has calming abilities,"Achillea millefolium extract, more commonly known as yarrow extract, is the extract from the whole yarrow plant, a type of flowering herb native to North America and parts of Europe and Asia. It’s a rich source of antioxidant flavonoids, phenolics, and various fatty acids that contribute to healthier-looking skin. Long used in European folk medicine (particularly for internal ailments), research is diving deeper into Achillea millefolium extract’s topical benefit for skin, and the results are highly encouraging. Studies show this extract has antioxidant properties that can rejuvenate skin’s surface, leading to a more youthful appearance. Of particular interest is research showing that Achillea millefolium extract can fight factors that lead to visible skin irritation – essentially, that it is a calming ingredient. Research has also shown that various compounds in this plant’s oil, particularly linalyl acetate, play a role in fading the appearance of dark spots; however, this compound is also a source of fragrance and can irritate skin. For this reason, we prefer the extract form of this plant instead of the oil. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review has ruled that Achillea millefolium extract is safe as used in cosmetics at its current concentrations, which range from 0.000005-0.04%. The bioavailability of this extract is improved when added to a glycol base."

This seed oil has a rich composition that includes fatty acids and phenolic compounds. Palmitic, oleic, and linoleic acid account for most of Adansonia digitata seed oil’s fatty acid content. They naturally occur in the human body, with linoleic acid being the most abundant fatty acid found within the epidermis (skin needs linoleic acid to make ceramides). When applied topically to skin, these ingredients help soothe, smooth and hydrate skin. Phenolic compounds in Adansonia digitata seed oil lend themselves to the skin care ingredient’s antioxidant properties. Phenolic compounds assist in protecting skin from environmental stressors that can lead to signs of extrinsic aging, like fine lines and wrinkles. As a raw material, this skin care ingredient is a pale yellow oil. An analysis of cosmetics products concluded that Adansonia digitata seed oil is used in percentages up to 0.01%, most often in leave-on formulas; however, larger amounts may be used if desired.

Adenosine,Best,Soothing,"Soothing, Plant Extracts",Helps improve the visible appearance of wrinkles | Has soothing properties | Also smooths skin's surface,"Adenosine is a water-soluble yeast-derived ingredient that functions as a good soothing and skin-restoring agent. It has proven anti-wrinkle benefits and is a safe, beneficial ingredient all skin types can use. Studies also indicate strong potential for soothing properties. One of the particularly exceptional qualities of adenosine is that it’s a natural component of the body and its receptors have specifically been identified in skin cells, allowing for a direct connection and impressive effectiveness when applied topically. In one study (conducted by L’Oreal) adenosine showed efficacy in as low as 0.1% concentration for improving deep wrinkles in the periorbital area (i.e. crow’s feet) as well as glabellar frown lines (known as the 11s between brows). In 2020, the Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety concluded that adenosine was safe in concentrations of up to 1% in leave on skin care products.

It is a nucleotide, which means it is a combination of a nitrogenous base (adenine), a sugar (ribose), and a phosphate (triphosphate). In the human body, ATP provides energy to support numerous functions, including muscle contraction and the synthesis of chemicals the body requires to maintain health. In skin care products, adenosine triphosphate provides soothing benefits. Since it’s also an antioxidant, it helps fight free-radical damage that can cause signs of aging. There is also mounting evidence that topically applied ATP can fight inflammation, in part because the body (including skin’s uppermost layers) has adenosine receptors. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled adenosine triphosphate safe in its current practices and usages. The typical range of adenosine triphosphate used in cosmetics is typically 0.1–0.5% when part of a blend."

AHAs are derived naturally from various plant sources and from milk, but 99% of the AHAs used in cosmetics are synthetically derived. In low concentrations (less than 3%), AHAs work as water-binding agents. At concentrations greater than 4% and in a base with an acid pH of 3 to 4, these ingredients can exfoliate by breaking down the substance that holds dead skin together. The most effective and well-researched AHAs are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be effective. AHAs have been widely used for improving signs of aging, dry skin, and an uneven skin tone. Routine use can lead to younger-looking, remarkably smoother skin. Caution is warranted when it comes to AHA products with very high concentrations (above 10% when used alone or 30% when combined) or when the pH falls below 3, as this increases the risk of irritation. Paula’s Choice avoids these issues with all our AHA exfoliants. There is a vast amount of research that substantially describes how the aging process affects skin and that demonstrates that many of the unwanted changes can be improved by topical application of AHAs, including glycolic and lactic acids. AHA use can result in increased sensitivity to the sun, though wearing a sunscreen daily eliminates this risk. Note: AHAs are of little benefit when added to rinse-off products, as their contact with skin is too brief for them to function as exfoliants or absorb into skin."

Allantoin,Best,Soothing,"Soothing, Plant Extracts",Can soothe skin | Has skin moisturizing properties | Helps mitigate skin’s response to active ingredients | Occurs naturally in most organisms but can be produced synthetically | Used in concentrations up to 2% in cosmetics,"Allantoin is a byproduct of uric acid that can be extracted from urea and is the result of metabolic processes that occur in most organisms - among them animals (including humans) and bacteria. It can also be extracted from comfrey (taken from the roots and leaves) and is proven safe and effective because it does not contain the potentially irritating alkaloid compounds that occur in the comfrey plant. Despite the natural source of allantoin being safe, the type of allantoin used in skin care products is generally produced synthetically as this guarantees no impurities while sacrificing none of allantoin’s effectiveness. It serves as an effective soothing agent and has moisturizing properties, giving it value especially in products designed to treat sensitive or compromised skin. It can also help mitigate skin’s response to stronger active ingredients and is often included in formulas to help buffer any potential adverse effects. In cosmetics, it is used in concentrations up to 2%, but in clinical settings it can be used in greater amounts, where research has shown it can have an impact on healing. In the United States, it is FDA-approved as an over the counter (OTC) skin protectant in concentrations of 0.5-2%."

Components of aloe vera leaf include minerals, polyphenols, and vitamins. This commonly used plant extract offers antioxidant qualities to defend skin from environmental stressors. Studies also show it delivers soothing properties and serves as a humectant (hydrating agent). Although aloe is indeed beneficial for skin, its benefits are sometimes over-exaggerated in the world of cosmetics. For instance, some skin care brands tout aloe as an anti-aging cure-all for wrinkles—unfortunately, it doesn’t have that kind of power. That said, it’s still a great addition to see in your skin care products for its research-supported benefits. Aloe barbadensis leaf extract has been deemed safe for skin care use by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel.

Alpha-Arbutin,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","Proven ability to fade melanin-fueled skin discolorations | Considered more effective than beta-arbutin and kojic acid | May be plant-derived, bio-fermented or synthetic. | Derived from gold standard hyperpigmentation ingredient hydroquinone","Alpha-arbutin is a plant-derived or synthetic ingredient that helps to brighten, fade discolorations, protect skin from oxidative stress and promote a more even skin tone. It is made from hydroquinone and the alpha form of the sugar molecule, glucose. Its mechanism of action on skin isn’t fully understood; however, it’s believed to work by interrupting or limiting the ability of an enzyme in skin (known as tyrosinase) from making too much melanin. This in turn helps reduce the size and appearance of surface discolorations. As an antioxidant, alpha-arbutin can help neutralize skin-damaging free radicals and also help boost skin’s natural antioxidant defenses. It was once thought that alpha-arbutin works because it breaks down to hydroquinone on skin, but now we know that the amount of hydroquinone produced from alpha-arbutin is likely too low to play a role in its discoloration-fading benefits. Interestingly, it seems microorganisms on skin’s surface and/or exposure to UV light are the triggers that release some of the hydroquinone used to create alpha-arbutin. Research has shown that alpha-arbutin works synergistically with other proven ingredients to visibly reduce hyperpigmentation, including tranexamic acid, vitamin C, niacinamide, and retinaldehyde (retinal). Typical usage levels of alpha-arbutin in skin care range from 0.4–5%, although cosmetic ingredient reviews boards recommend a maximum usage level of 2% in leave-on products as being safe. Alpha-arbutin may be produced via fermentation of soybeans. Plants such as mulberry are typical sources of beta-arbutin, which isn’t considered as effective as the synthesized alpha form."

Studies also suggest alpha-glucan possesses antioxidant potential. Worth noting, alpha-glucan’s molecular structure allows it to enhance the delivery of other ingredients in a formulation. This means that other beneficial substances in the product can penetrate deeper into the skin, potentially increasing their effectiveness and maximizing their impact. Alpha-glucan may be derived from natural sources such as fungi (think mushrooms). While alpha-glucan offers prebiotic benefits when applied topically to the skin, it does not have the same effect when ingested. Due to its large size, alpha-glucan cannot be fermented by gut bacteria; instead, it passes through the digestive system as insoluble fiber. Note: Skin-specific benefits of alpha-glucan have not been as extensively researched as other glucans such as beta-glucan and alpha-glucan oligosaccharide (a popular skin care ingredient derived from alpha-glucan, though the two offer different properties/benefits). You can learn more about those ingredients via their individual entries."

When skin’s microbiome (it’s invisible barrier) is disrupted, the population of harmful bacteria can grow since it’s not being kept in check by healthy flora on the surface. This has the potential to trigger signs of irritation and sensitized skin. Alpha and beta-glucan oligosaccharides also have antioxidant benefit, helping to reduce the visible effects of oxidative stress on skin. Recommended usage levels of alpha-glucan oligosaccharide in skin care range from 0.25–3% on its own and 0.5–3% when part of a blend with other prebiotics."
AHA,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Hydration, Exfoliant, Humectant",AKA alpha hydroxy acid | Exfoliates skin and improves visible signs of aging | Particularly suited for dry skin and an uneven skin tone | Includes glycolic and lactic acids,"Acronym for alpha hydroxy acid. AHAs are derived naturally from various plant sources and from milk, but 99% of the AHAs used in cosmetics are synthetically derived. In low concentrations (less than 3%), AHAs work as water-binding agents. At concentrations greater than 4% and in a base with an acid pH of 3 to 4, these ingredients can exfoliate by breaking down the substance that holds dead skin together. The most effective and well-researched AHAs are glycolic acid and lactic acid. Malic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid may also be effective. AHAs have been widely used for improving signs of aging, dry skin, and an uneven skin tone. Routine use can lead to younger-looking, remarkably smoother skin. Caution is warranted when it comes to AHA products with very high concentrations (above 10% when used alone or 30% when combined) or when the pH falls below 3, as this increases the risk of irritation. Paula’s Choice avoids these issues with all our AHA exfoliants. There is a vast amount of research that substantially describes how the aging process affects skin and that demonstrates that many of the unwanted changes can be improved by topical application of AHAs, including glycolic and lactic acids. AHA use can result in increased sensitivity to the sun, though wearing a sunscreen daily eliminates this risk. Note: AHAs are of little benefit when added to rinse-off products, as their contact with skin is too brief for them to function as exfoliants or absorb into skin."
Alpha Lipoic Acid,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant",AKA thioctic acid | Both water and oil soluble | Exerts antioxidant and soothing properties when applied topically | Concentrations of 5% or greater are capable of causing a burning or stinging sensation on skin,"Alpha lipoic acid, also known as thioctic acid, is a caprylic acid-derived antioxidant. Alpha lipoic acid is unique among antioxidants, because due to its structure it is both water and oil soluble. When applied topically on skin, it appears to be a very good antioxidant. Taken internally, alpha lipoic acid is a water- and fat-soluble antioxidant capable of regenerating other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E. It is also believed to exert numerous soothing effects. It’s clear from the research that alpha lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant, but it isn’t the only one; there are lots of great antioxidants for skin. In fact, there isn’t a lot of research on topical application of alpha lipoic acid. This ingredient’s extremely vulnerable to degradation by sunlight. Higher concentrations (5% or greater) are capable of causing a burning or stinging sensation on skin."

As such, it can also be said that this plant helps maintain skin’s hydration. The mucilage (a gelatinous fluid) of this plant contains skin-smoothing polysaccharides including glucuronic acid, rhamnose and galactose. Usage levels in cosmetics range from 1–5% when in solution with ingredients such as glycerin or various glycols. In such a blend, approximately 2–5% is Althaea officinalis root, meaning it doesn’t take much to get visible results from this plant. Along with documented soothing benefits, Althaea officinalis root has also been shown to interrupt oxidative damage generated within skin after exposure to UVA light, although this benefit varied based on how the plant was grown and cultivated. As an interesting aside unrelated to cosmetics, the root of this plant has been used internally to relieve a dry cough resulting from mucosal/throat irritation. Althaea officinalis root extract is considered safe for use on skin."

While most of the independent research pertaining to this ingredient has been done in relation to its nutritional and medicinal value, studies indicated the seeds’ robust mix of phytochemicals offer great potential for improving various aspects of skin health, including anti-aging effects. In particular, the antioxidants demonstrate skin-protective effects against environmental stressors. Amaranthus caudatus seed extract may also offer moisturizing benefits (it can be manufactured as an aqueous solution or oil form depending on how its processed). This ingredient is incorporated into various cosmetics formulations ranging from facial serums to hair care. At the time of this writing, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has not done a safety assessment on this ingredient. Currently, there is no indication of concerns. Fun fact: The Amaranthus caudatus plant is more commonly known as velvet flower or kiwicha. Amaranthus plants are found throughout the world, thriving under a wide range of climatic conditions. They produce grains and leafy edible vegetables and are considered of high nutritional value."

Some of these amino acids can be synthesized by the body; others (known as essential amino acids) must be obtained from protein in the diet. In skin care products, amino acids act as water-binding agents, and some have antioxidant properties. Amino acids can be combined with other ingredients that have skin-restorative ability to work in unison to fight signs of aging. Note: Research has shown amino acids for skin work best when several of them are combined. For this reason, we rate the amino acids as a group more highly than some individual amino acids. Although some individual amino acids have distinctive benefits compared to others, you would be selling your skin short if you only focused on one particular amino acid."

Like some other plants, Anastatica hierochuntica can survive in harsh climactic conditions, including extra-dry environments. However, what allows a plant to do this in nature doesn’t exactly translate when the extract is applied to skin. That said, certain aspects of the plant should help skin better withstand environmental assault and hence have an anti-aging effect. Research has shown that this plant extract is a potent antioxidant and soothing ingredient, although it isn’t as well-researched as many other plants more widely used in cosmetics. Still, it’s an intriguing ingredient that along with antioxidant benefit may also improve skin tone by modulating factors in skin’s surface that trigger discoloration. Of note, phytochemical studies of Anastatica hierochuntica have shown it contains the beneficial compound quercetin. This plant has a long history of use in folk medicine and is indigenous to the Middle East and parts of North Africa."

Its formal Latin name is Chamaemelum nobile . Chamomile’s use in traditional medicine dates to the Middle Ages, when it was used as a digestive aid and a painkiller. Modern research finds that Anthemis nobilis flower extract is a rich source of antioxidants in the form of polyphenols, compounds which fight oxidative stress. It also has soothing properties. Adverse responses to chamomile have been reported among those who are aggravated by other plants in the daisy family. If you’re allergic to plants in the daisy family, you may need to avoid products that contain chamomile. It’s also important to make sure that you’re selecting products with Anthemis nobilis flower extract instead of oil, as the oil contains volatile compounds that cause sensitization, even if you don’t have a daisy allergy. Confusingly, the oil from chamomile also contains soothing properties but the risk from the less desirable compounds is too great. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has found Anthemis nobilis flower extract safe as it is currently used in skin care products. Reported concentrations of this extract in leave-on and rinse-off products range from 0.000025-0.1%."

The plant-derived form is known as beta-arbutin and the synthetic forms are alpha-arbutin and deoxyarbutin. Each is backed by research for addressing hyperpigmentation issues (i.e. fading dark spots and other discolorations), as well as improving skin’s overall radiance. Arbutin’s main benefit comes from the fact that it naturally breaks down into hydroquinone (which is known to inhibit excess melanin). This allows it to even out skin tone and minimize blotchy/patchy spots that are caused by factors such as unprotected sun exposure. Studies have shown the synthetic derivatives alpha-arbutin and deoxyarbutin are more effective in this regard than the pure natural form of beta-arbutin due to having better stability, longer efficacy, and no risk of sensitivity when exposed to human skin cells. As a raw material, arbutin comes in powder form, with a colorless to faint yellow appearance. The Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety recognizes up to a 2% concentration of alpha-arbutin and 7% concentration of beta-arbutin as safe in facial skin care products."

As a skin care ingredient, it delivers antioxidant benefits and plays a role in repairing visible skin damage. Additionally, arginine’s hydration properties have been studied in depth. This essential amino acid plays a key role in skin’s natural production of replenishing substances such as proline and urea. Arginine may be animal-derived or synthetic; both are equivalent in terms of benefits for skin, and Paula’s Choice uses the latter. Researchers are currently exploring the use of cosmetic surfactants derived from arginine as a more “biocompatible” alternative to traditional forms. In the realm of hair care, arginine has been shown to decrease damage from oxidative coloring or bleaching processes. In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that arginine is safe in the present practices of use and concentration (up to 18%) in cosmetics. It is also known as l-arginine."

Also known as acetyl hexapeptide-8 and acetyl hexapeptide-3, it, like all peptides, has water-binding properties and skin-restoring abilities. It is considered a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide, meaning it works within skin’s surface layers to interrupt the look of expression lines; however, its efficacy in this regard doesn’t replace in-office wrinkle-smoothing injectable procedures. Interestingly, research from suppliers has shown this peptide also helps support skin’s collagen and preserve a firmer appearance. On the other hand, research has shown this peptide can penetrate further into skin if specific formulary steps are followed, including the type of emulsion (a higher water content showed greater penetration). As always, this demonstrates the importance of selecting well-formulated skin care products to add to your routine."
Aristotelia Chilensis (Maqui),Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",,"Maqui, also known as Chilean wineberry, is a richly-colored berry that contains a potent type of antioxidant anthocyanidin known as delphinidins, which can help skin better withstand the rigors of UV light exposure (but just to be clear, this ingredient does not replace the need for sunscreen). Maqui is also a great antioxidant when consumed orally, largely due to the action of its polyphenols, flavanols, other anthocyanins, and ellagic acid, all of which work to squelch damaging free radicals that, left unchecked, can lead to health issues."
Ascorbic Acid,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer",Technical name for pure vitamin C | Can help improve wrinkles + discolorations | Helps boost sunscreen effectiveness | The most abundant antioxidant in skin,"Ascorbic acid - also known as L-ascorbic acid - has the most research of any form of vitamin C when it comes to skin, and in fact is the most abundant naturally occurring antioxidant in our skin. Concentrations between 5-20% can improve numerous the appearance of signs of aging, including discolorations, wrinkles, and loss of firmness due to sun damage. Lower concentrations such as those between 0.3-2% also offer benefits, such as improvement of uneven skin tone, fine lines, and boosting skin’s antioxidant supply. Ascorbic acid is also a powerhouse when mixed with other antioxidants, especially vitamin E, and is particularly great for evening out skin tone when used alone in higher concentrations, such as 15%, 20%, or greater. Vitamins C and E work together to keep each other stabilized and able to exert their benefits in skin longer. In order to be most effective in higher concentrations, any water-based vitamin C formula’s pH should be 3.5 or lower. This helps improve stability and permeability of ascorbic acid, allowing it to do more than work as an antioxidant. Ascorbic acid is a particularly vulnerable antioxidant when exposed to UV light and air, so it must be packaged to protect it from these elements during routine use. If not, its effectiveness will gradually become diminished to the point of not working at all. You will see this as discoloration from oxidation which causes the product to turn a copper to brownish color. For this reason, avoid any vitamin C (ascorbic acid) products packaged in traditional, open-mouthed jars or clear bottles. Dropper-based dispenser-type packaging should also have air-restrictive capabilities to improve stability. And for maximum potency, it’s best to use a water-based vitamin C treatment within 3 months of opening. With once-daily usage, most people will find they go through their vitamin C product within a couple months. Considered safe as used in cosmetics, ascorbic acid is also fine to use with retinol and niacinamide without any of these ingredients causing the other to break down or lose effectiveness beyond what would normally occur due to air and light exposure, which is why ingredients like these need to be routinely applied."
Ascorbyl Glucosamine,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant",,Form of vitamin C that has little research showing it has the antioxidant or skin-brightening properties of other forms of vitamin C.
Ascorbyl Glucoside,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant",Stable form of vitamin C easily penetrates skin | Brightening benefits enhanced by niacinamide | Helps improve skin’s environmental defenses,"Ascorbyl glucoside is a stable form of vitamin C combined with the sugar glucose. The glucose is derived from a natural starch source, such as rice, while the vitamin C portion is synthetic. When properly formulated and absorbed into skin, it breaks down to ascorbic acid, also known as pure vitamin C. Once absorbed, its breakdown to vitamin C is gradual, creating what’s known as a reservoir effect within skin. This leads to longer-lasting benefits. Sometimes referred to as AA2G, ascorbyl glucoside functions as an antioxidant and works well with other replenishing and antioxidant ingredients to preserve key substances skin needs to look smoother, brighter, and younger. Research on ascorbyl glucoside’s ability to improve uneven skin tone and hyperpigmentation is encouraging but not as extensive when compared with the decades of research amassed for ascorbic acid; however, ascorbyl glucoside plus the B vitamin niacinamide is a viable combination to consider, and several skin care products pair these ingredients. Ascorbyl glucoside is typically used in concentrations of 2-5% when brightening dull skin and fading the look of hyperpigmentation is the goal. Products with higher concentrations are available, but comparative research with commonly used concentrations is lacking. Levels of 0.5% and above can provide antioxidant benefits and help neutralize the damage associated with exposure to airborne pollutants and other environmental threats. It’s considered safe as used in cosmetics, both rinse-off and leave-on. Ascorbyl glucoside is widely compatible with other cosmetic ingredients. Unlike the tight pH range ascorbic acid needs to be effective on skin, ascorbyl glucoside works between a pH of 5-8, with the lower end of this spectrum considered better due to being a close match to the normal pH range of skin."
Ascorbyl Methylsilanol Pectinate,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Antioxidant, Texture Enhancer",,Form of vitamin C that is considered stable and that functions as an antioxidant and thickening agent.
Ascorbyl Palmitate,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant",Made by combining ascorbic acid with palmitic acid | Has a powerful synergy with vitamin E | Exhibits antioxidant benefits | Not considered as effective as pure vitamin C | Often used to help stabilize air-sensitive skin care ingredients | Also used as a food additive to improve stability of oils,"Ascorbyl palmitate is a stable, oil-soluble form of vitamin C that is made by combining ascorbic acid with a fatty acid known as palmitic acid. It’s also known as ascorbyl-6 palmitate, and it is effective up to a pH of 6. Pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) requires a pH of 3.5 or lower to work, making ascorbyl palmitate easier to formulate with. Although ascorbyl palmitate has antioxidant benefit for skin, research has shown it doesn’t penetrate as well as pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and that its conversion to vitamin C isn’t as efficient as other forms (such as tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate). This helps explain why ascorbyl palmitate isn’t the leading form of vitamin C in products meant to address lack of firmness, wrinkles, and discolorations. Research has shown that a modified form of this ingredient, known as trisodium ascorbyl-6 palmitate 2-phosphate overcomes this conversion issue. The palmitate portion of this ingredient lends it hydrating properties many other forms of vitamin C do not have. Interestingly, although ascorbyl palmitate is considered a stable form of vitamin C, research has shown other forms possess greater stability and skin can more freely convert those forms to ascorbic acid. However, a comparative study showed that ascorbyl palmitate maintains adequate stability in different types of emulsions when it is encapsulated. Ascorbyl palmitate is often used in skin care at amounts between 0.1-1% where its antioxidant ability helps stabilize more delicate ingredients, including pure vitamin C; however, it’s not impervious to breaking down with ongoing exposure to heat and oxygen, as data from multiple ingredient suppliers attests. Ascorbyl palmitate is considered safe in the amounts commonly used in skin care and makeup products. A 2002 study in the Journal of Investigative Dermatology suggested that ascorbyl palmitate can cause oxidative damage to skin when the lipid (palmitate) portion oxidizes upon exposure to UVB light. However, it’s important to note that the irradiated keratinocytes (skin cells) in this study weren’t treated with any UV filter, only the ascorbyl palmitate. In essence, this is like testing an umbrella’s ability to keep you dry on a sunny day without rain. The results are inconclusive without a proper control (rain, or, in the case of this study, a UV filter) to measure against. This study also didn’t show what would happen if other antioxidants such as green tea were in the mix."

Asiatic Acid,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant","Potent antioxidant found naturally in many plants, including Centella asiatica | Helps offset triggers of sun damage and aging skin | Delivers significant soothing properties | Works best when penetration-enhancing delivery systems are utilized to improve the permeability","Asiatic acid is a potent antioxidant that is found naturally in many plants, including Centella asiatica , Actinidia arguta, Maytenus procumbens, and Psidium guajava . It’s used in skin care to help inhibit triggers of sun damage and aging skin. More specifically, studies demonstrate asiatic acid’s potential for reducing glycative activity (one of the causes of aging skin). This ingredient works along various pathways of skin, which equates to multitasking benefits, including soothing. Certain researchers point out asiatic acid has low bioavailability due to poor solubility in solution. This limits its practical use in topical products. However, cosmetic chemists can work around this by utilizing penetration-enhancing delivery systems to improve the permeability and affinity for skin. A derivative of asiatic acid known as AAGS (asiatic acid and glucosamine) can also be used to deliver these benefits. Asiatic acid presents as a white powder in its raw material form. Recommend usage levels vary by supplier, typically ranging between 0.01-0.5%. In addition to its cosmetic benefits for skin, asiatic acid has been extensively studied for its medicinal uses and oral applications."

It is a naturally occurring red pigment that gives certain species of shrimp their red coloring. It is also used commercially as a food additive since it’s considered Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Studies find that astaxanthin has a wealth of benefits when applied to skin. It is a rich source of antioxidants that fight the oxidative stress that leads to visible skin aging. It also has anti-inflammatory properties that soothe reactive skin. Perhaps most interesting is that some studies point to astaxanthin’s ability to boost the UV protection of sunscreens because of its natural ability to deflect UV rays. Note: astaxanthin is not an FDA approved UV filter, so it should not be relied upon solely for sun protection. Still, its potential to improve sunscreen performance makes it an exciting ingredient to see included in skin care products. Use levels of astaxanthin in skin care typically range from 0.01–0.07%. These low amounts, which will impart color to a formula, are a testament to how potent this antioxidant is."

Avena Sativa (Oat) Kernel Extract,Best,Soothing,"Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",Good source of antioxidants | Exhibits impressive skin-soothing abilities | Suitable for even the most sensitive skin | INCI name for ingredient also called colloidal oatmeal | Ruled safe as used in cosmetics,"Avena sativa (oat) kernel extract is the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) name for a skin care ingredient you may know as colloidal oatmeal. It is primarily referred to as such on skin care product labels when included as an active ingredient in an over the counter (OTC) formula. Colloidal oatmeal is made when oat kernels are ground into a fine powder that easily disperses in a liquid emulsion. Oat kernel extract – as is the case with most plant extracts – is a good source of antioxidants that fight off the ravages of environmental stressors for a more youthful appearance. Where this ingredient truly shines though is its ability to soothe even the most stressed, irritated skin. It’s not a stretch to say that oat kernel extract is almost legendary in this regard! Studies point to oatmeal’s potent soothing properties coming from its ability to inhibit inflammatory cytokines, which are types of small proteins that help control the body’s inflammatory response. By inhibiting these cytokines, colloidal oatmeal helps the body better deal with irritation. This calming effect also helps improve skin barrier strength. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled Avena sativa (oat) kernel extract safe in its current use in cosmetics – where it is included as an ingredient in nearly 500 products. When it’s an active ingredient, use levels of colloidal oatmeal range from 0.5–2%, although amounts as low as 0.007% may be used for this purpose."

Avobenzone,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",A globally approved synthetic UVA filter | Has been tested for safety and efficacy | One of only two FDA-approved UVA filters | Also known as Parsol 1789,"Avobenzone is a synthetic sunscreen ingredient that provides sun protection in the UVA range. This type of radiation is present all day long, and penetrates deeply into skin, where it causes a cascade of damage that leads to many signs of aging. Avobenzone is globally approved. In fact, it’s one of the most widely used UVA filters in the world and has been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, with further safety studies ongoing. Avobenzone is one of only two UVA absorbers allowed by the U.S. FDA (the other is zinc oxide). UVA absorbers are needed in order to provide sunscreens with the ability to make a broad-spectrum UV claim. In the United States, it may be used as an over-the-counter sunscreen active up to 3%. Its maximum permitted concentration extends to 5% within the European Union, where it’s been in use since 1978 (it was FDA-approved in 1996). Many studies have shown that avobenzone becomes unstable when exposed to UV light, one reason reapplication during long periods of time outdoors is necessary. To increase its photostability, UV absorbers such as octocrylene and non-UV filters (e.g., diethylhexyl 2, 6-napththalate) often accompany avobenzone in a sunscreen formula. Synthetic and natural antioxidants (such as vitamin E ubiquinone, glutathione, and diethylhexyl syringylidenemalonate) have can also improve avobenzone’s photostability, as can the proper choice of emollients, one example being caprylic/capric triglyceride. Other ingredients used to stabilize avobenzone and allow it to be used with other filters such as octinoxate include polyester-8 and ethylhexyl methoxycrylene. Avobenzone is one of several sunscreen ingredients currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing. Note: this UV filter is also known as Parsol 1789 or butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane, but avobenzone is the official name when used in sunscreens."

Bacillus ferment can improve skin in numerous ways; however, the specific benefits vary greatly depending on the particular strain employed in the fermentation process. Some forms of Bacillus ferment exhibit enzymatic activity, allowing them to mildly exfoliate skin’s surface. Others are primarily focused on supporting the skin’s microbiome, a complex ecosystem of microorganisms essential for overall skin health. Bacillus ferments can be categorized as peptides, probiotics, or prebiotics. They may also provide skin-soothing properties and can help boost hydration and aid barrier repair. As a skin care ingredient, Bacillus ferment is typically blended with other ingredients like glycols where the overall concentrations range from 0.5% to 3%. Higher concentrations may be particularly beneficial for those with blemish-prone skin due to this ingredient’s soothing action and positive impact on the skin’s microbiome. When you see Bacillus ferment on a cosmetic product’s ingredient list, you can expect one or more of the benefits mentioned above, but it’s also possible the ingredient will deliver other benefits, again depending on how it was made and what resulted from the fermentation process."
Bakuchiol,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Offers multiple anti-aging benefits | Helps improve the look of skin discolorations | Offers many of the same benefits as retinol | Antioxidant found in the seeds and leaves of the plant Psoralea corylifolia | Works best in concentrations between 0.5-2%,"Bakuchiol is a natural antioxidant and anti-aging ingredient found in the seeds and leaves of the plant Psoralea corylifolia . This plant, also known as babchi, is native to India and is also found in China as well as parts of Africa. Ongoing in vitro (Petri dish) and in vivo (on skin) research has shown that bakuchiol has a skin-restoring ability, as well as an effect on brightening a dull complexion. In particular, it can help reduce skin discolorations, including post-breakout marks, and clarify uneven tone. Research has also shown this plant ingredient has a significant soothing effect and also offers wrinkle-reducing properties. Bakuchiol is often touted as a natural alternative to retinol. The association between bakuchiol and retinol is because many of its visible benefits seem to mimic what retinol does. While the two are not identical, science has revealed that bakuchiol interacts with many of the same areas in skin as retinol, sometimes by taking the same pathway, other times by going a different route but still leading to the similar results, such as diminished wrinkles, improved elasticity, and smoother skin. In either case, we’re confident that bakuchiol is a promising, beneficial ingredient. By the way, it’s perfectly OK to use a product that combines retinol and bakuchiol together. Doing so builds on the overlapping and unique benefits each has to offer. Bakuchiol also has a natural stabilizing effect on vitamin A (retinol). Research has confirmed that bakuchiol works best in concentrations between 0.5-2%. Amounts lower than that have not been shown to provide retinol-like benefits."

Benzoyl Peroxide,Best,"Anti-Acne, Smooths Bumpy Skin","Anti-Acne, Smooths Bumpy Skin, Antibacterial",OTC topical antibacterial acne treatment | Helps fight acne bacteria at the source | Does not disrupt skin’s microbiome | Solutions range in strength from 2.5% to 10%,"Benzoyl peroxide is widely considered the most effective over-the-counter choice for a topical antibacterial agent in the treatment of acne. The amount of research (well over five decades) demonstrating the effectiveness of benzoyl peroxide is exhaustive and conclusive. Among benzoyl peroxide’s attributes is its ability to penetrate the hair follicle to reach the bacteria that cause the problem, and then kill them—with a low risk of sensitivity. It also doesn’t pose the problem of bacterial resistance that some prescription topical antibacterials (antibiotics) do. You might think the use of benzoyl peroxide would disrupt skin’s microbiome, the delicate balance of microorganisms that affect how skin looks and feels. Research has shown that this is not the case, and in fact it can have a balancing effect, since it regulates the proliferation of P. acnes bacteria. Benzoyl peroxide treatments range in strength from 2.5% to 10%. It is best to start with lower concentrations because a 2.5% benzoyl peroxide product is much less irritating than a 5% or 10% concentration, and it can be just as effective. Because of its low systemic absorption, it is considered generally safe for use by people who are pregnant or breastfeeding. It is metabolized within the skin to benzoic acid and any residual amount that is absorbed into the body is quickly excreted via urine. Benzoyl peroxide is considered a weak allergen and tends to only cause irritation if applied too frequently or to skin whose barrier is impaired."

It is commonly included in skin care products as a soothing agent and is considered an excellent ingredient for minimizing redness and other signs of sensitive skin. Beta-glucan also offers antioxidant properties and has been shown to help visibly minimize signs of aging/sun damage (including reducing the look of wrinkle depth and rough, uneven tone). Certain sources of beta-glucan also offer film-forming moisturizing properties. In early research, it was hypothesized that beta-glucan’s high molecular weight would inhibit it from penetrating skin, thereby limiting its benefits to just the surface, but in more recent studies, beta-glucan has been proven to permeate skin by passing between cells. In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed beta-glucan as safe in cosmetic formulations in the present practices of use at a 1% max concentration."

Salicylic acid is a desmolytic ingredient, which means it is able to exfoliate by dissolving the bonds that hold the dead cells to skin’s surface. Because salicylic acid is oil soluble, it also has the ability to penetrate into the pore lining and exfoliate inside the pore. This makes it especially effective for reducing breakouts, including blackheads and whiteheads. Salicylic acid is recognized as an over-the-counter topical acne product by the U.S. FDA, when used in concentrations of 0.5-2%. Even though salicylic acid is best known for its ability to address acne-prone skin concerns, it offers many additional properties that any skin type can benefit from. Case in point, by exfoliating the buildup of dead skin on the surface, it also helps reverse the appearance of dull, uneven skin tone, as well as other visible signs of aging skin. Unlike physical exfoliants (such as a rough facial scrub), salicylic acid offers hydrating properties that enhance the result of smooth, soft skin. Another unique advantage is salicylic acid’s ability to gently soothe aggravated skin thanks to its inherent calming properties. Salicylic acids works most effectively as a leave-on treatment, ideally within a pH range between 3 and 4. Rinse-off salicylic acid cleansers typically have a higher pH, which likely won’t offer much of an exfoliation benefitnot to mention the contact time with skin is very brief - but the salicylic acid may at least offer skin-calming benefits in this form and can be included in amounts as low as 0.5% to achieve this benefit. Research shows using salicylic acid starting at a 1-2% concentration is recommended for regular exfoliation within a skin care routine. For more stubborn concerns, higher concentrations can make a dramatic difference. In dermatologic practices, salicylic acid has been safely used in as high as 50% concentrations for removal of warts, corns, pigmented lesions, and other advanced concerns. Salicylic acid has been found to be safe on all skin tones and ethnicities. Note that BHA is the structural name for salicylic acid and is completely unrelated to the preservative ingredient BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole)."

Bisabolol,Best,"Soothing, Anti-Aging","Soothing, Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",Skin-soothing ingredient | May offer some discoloration-fading properties | Commonly derived from chamomile,"Bisabolol is a well-known skin soothing agent. It comes in two different structural forms: alpha-bisabolol, derived from chamomile and other plants (although it can also be lab-created) vs. beta-bisabolol which is found in cotton and corn. The alpha form is the one used in skin care products. Bisabolol is commonly found in many personal care products, including moisturizers, cleansers, and serums. It often plays a bio-active skin-calming role thanks to its anti-inflammatory properties and shows up in many products designed for sensitive skin. Beyond its soothing properties, research indicates bisabolol may offer some discoloration-fading capabilities. The naturally sweet, slightly floral scent of bisabolol means it is sometimes used in higher amounts to impart fragrance to a formula. However, in lower amounts it doesn’t impart much, if any, scent and its soothing compounds easily outweigh any risk of irritation. Because bisabolol is typically derived from chamomile, and chamomile is a member of the ragweed family, it may be best to avoid it if you have a confirmed allergy to ragweed. As a raw material, bisabolol is a colorless to light yellow, oily liquid. In 2017, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) council concluded that bisabolol is safe used up to 1% concentration in leave-on formulations. The CIR also noted that bisabolol can enhance the penetration of other ingredients in a formula."

This type of radiation is present all day long, and penetrates deeply into skin, where it causes a cascade of damage that leads to many signs of aging. Better known as avobenzone, butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane is globally approved. In fact, it’s one of the most widely used UVA filters in the world and has been rigorously tested for safety and efficacy, with further safety studies ongoing. In the United States, it may be used as an over-the-counter sunscreen active up to 3%. Its maximum permitted concentration extends to 5% within the European Union, where it’s been in use since 1978 (it was FDA-approved in 1996). Many studies have shown that avobenzone becomes unstable when exposed to UV light, one reason reapplication during long periods of time outdoors is necessary. To increase its photostability, UV absorbers such as octocrylene and non-UV filters (e.g., diethylhexyl 2, 6-napththalate) often accompany avobenzone in a sunscreen formula. Synthetic and natural antioxidants (such as vitamin E ubiquinone, glutathione, and diethylhexyl syringylidenemalonate) have can also improve avobenzone’s photostability, as can the proper choice of emollients, one example being caprylic/capric triglyceride. Other ingredients used to stabilize avobenzone and allow it to be used with other filters such as octinoxate include polyester-8 and ethylhexyl methoxycrylene. Avobenzone is one of several sunscreen ingredients currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing. Note: this UV filter is also known as Parsol 1789, but avobenzone is the official name when used in sunscreens."

Along with offering antioxidant and pollution-neutralizing benefits on its own, topical application of Camellia japonica flower also boosts the presence of several antioxidant enzymes that naturally occur in skin, such as superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase. This helps skin better defend itself against external aggressors that detract from a healthy appearance. This plant is also a rich source of the oil-soluble antioxidant gallic acid and a compound known as Camellioside A. Its usage level in skin care is typically 0.1%."

Cannabidiol,Best,"Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"One of the components of the Cannabis sativa and Cannabis indica plants. Although listed on a cosmetic product by the approved name of cannabidiol, this ingredient is commonly referred to as CBD. Cannabidiol is one of numerous cannabinoids found primarily in the Cannabis species of plants. It occurs naturally in the flowering tops of the hemp plant (_Cannabis sativa_) but not in hemp seeds. Products that contain hemp seed oil that tout it as the source of cannabidiol most likely do not contain this substance (especially if you don’t see it listed among the product’s ingredients); however, it is possible to grow CBD-enriched hemp, where meaningful amounts of the cannabidiol is found in multiple parts of the plant. Confusing? Absolutely, which is why it’s important to only purchase CBD skin care from a trusted brand. Cannabidiol has been shown to offer numerous benefits related to calming skin. Skin has specific receptor sites for cannabinoids (referred to as its endocannabinoid system). It seems CBD can “talk” to these receptor sites on skin, sending unique signals to stop firing the wrong messages, which in turn leads to healthier, better-looking skin. This benefit makes cannabidiol an intriguing ingredient for interrupting the progression of damage within skin’s uppermost layers that can lead to visible problems; however, more research needs to be done to gain a greater understanding of how CBD works on skin. Research has also shown, though isn’t entirely clear on how this works, that CBD seems to visibly reduce oily skin. It’s also a very good antioxidant, on par with vitamins C and E. A quick note on the other compound in Cannabis that’s often mentioned, and that’s THC (tetrahydrocannabinol). This is the cannabinoid in marijuana (_Cannabis indica_) that has psychoactive effects (gets you high). The cannabidiol in skin care products must be THC-free, which means it contains 0.3% or less of this chemical, an amount lawmakers have deemed safe and unable to produce any sort of “high.” Last, the legal status of CBD in skin care (meaning for topical use only, not ingestion) appears to be on solid footing for now, but it’s a changing landscape that is being examined with an aim on clarifying its usage for consumers."

Of note, its mix of fatty acids replenish skin’s surface. It works to trap water within skin and discourage trans-epidermal water loss, resulting in balanced skin hydration. Through its emollient properties, it also works to smooth skin. Caprylic/capric triglyceride can also function as a thickener or penetration enhancer in skin care formulas and cosmetics, but its chief job is to moisturize and replenish skin. This ingredient’s value for skin is made greater by the fact that it’s considered gentle. As a raw material caprylic/capric triglyceride is clear, non-viscous liquid. It is known to improve to the spreadability of formula. Safety assessments have deemed capric/caprylic triglyceride safe in cosmetic formulations in concentrations below 50%, with reported uses varying between 0.1% to 35%. Despite what is often purported on the internet skin care advice sites, there is no research showing caprylic/capric triglyceride is “comedogenic” or pore clogging. (This assumption is often tied to its relation to coconut oil.) Theoretically, because its molecular weight of 408 is below 500 Daltons, caprylic/capric triglyceride technically has the ability to penetrate the pore lining, but even that doesn’t inherently mean it will clog pores."
Capryloyl Salicylic Acid,Best,"Anti-Acne, Blackhead Reducing, Soothing","Anti-Acne, Blackhead Reducing, Soothing, Exfoliant",,"Capryloyl salicylic acid is a derivative (ester) of salicylic acid developed by L’Oreal. In chemistry circles, it’s known as 2-hydroxyl-5-octanoyl benzoic acid, but skin care consumers most likely know it has lipohydroxy acid (LHA). The “lipo” portion is oil-soluble, although so is regular salicylic acid. To date, studies haven’t shown capryloyl salicylic acid is superior to salicylic acid; however, we know that LHA has a larger molecular size and along with its fatty acid structure has been shown to penetrate the skin slower than salicylic acid. In vitro studies have shown LHA tends to stay within the stratum corneum (the outermost layers of skin), while salicylic acid penetrates up to 58% further. This limitation may explain why capryloyl salicylic acid is not considered as effective for acne as salicylic acid. Speaking of acne, there is comparative research showing capryloyl salicylic acid used with benzoyl peroxide and/or a topical antibiotic produced slightly better results than using benzoyl peroxide and the topical antibiotic alone. While that’s encouraging, if you’re struggling with acne, regular salicylic acid should remain your go-to exfoliant. Just like salicylic acid, the capryloyl derivative has exfoliating and soothing properties as well as documented improvement in skin tone, wrinkles, and clogged pores. It also has the same formulary requirements around the pH range it works best, although unlike salicylic acid, in skin care LHA’s concentration is typically no greater than 1%. Interestingly, comparative research hasn’t focused on salicylic acid; instead, the single study that exists compared capryloyl salicylic acid to the alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) glycolic acid. In such instances, lower amounts (5-10%) of capryloyl salicylic acid were shown to produce an equivalent to superior level of visible improvement compared with much greater (20-50%) concentrations of glycolic acid. Due to the natural calming properties salicylic acid has, it wasn’t surprising that the LHA peels were perceived as less irritating than the AHA peel. Capryloyl salicylic acid is generally considered safe when used as directed. Note: Although studies on this ingredient were generally well done and followed scientific principles, it’s worth noting that all of them were either done by, funded by, or otherwise supported by L’Oreal. This does not mean the results cannot be counted on, only that there was incentive to cast this ingredient in its best light."

There is some research indicating carnosine offers antiglycation properties. (Glycation is a process that leads to wrinkles, so warding it off is a good thing.) Manufacturer studies also tout carnosine’s ability to boost collagen, but as is generally the case for peptides, specific formulary considerations and delivery systems have to be in place for carnosine to effectively reach where it would need to go to have that effect. Since carnosine occurs naturally in the body and plays a role in maintaining health, it is considered safe for topical use.

It plays a critical role as a major component of skin’s outer layers (healthy skin is generally composed of 50% ceramides, many of which are of the NP variety). “N” stands for the type of normal fatty acid correlated to this ingredient and “P” stands for its phytosphingosine base. Ceramides used in skin care can be created synthetically or sourced naturally from plants. Research shows skin care products containing ceramide NP can help improve the look and feel of dry or dehydrated skin thanks to its water retention properties. Ceramide NP has also been shown to reinforce skin’s barrier strength to better resist external stressors. Overall, it contributes to supple, resilient, hydrated skin. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel’s 2020 assessment concluded that ceramide ingredients are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use. Their survey data looked at personal care products containing concentrations up to 0.00005-0.2% ceramide NP."
Ceramide NS,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Emollient",Natural skin component that aids barrier strength | Aides in improving skin’s texture and hydration | Helps boost skin’s defenses,"Ceramide NS belongs to a larger group of ceramides that are naturally occurring, long chains of lipids (fats) that are major components of skin’s outer layers. In fact, skin’s composition is 50% ceramides. Ceramide NS in particular is a sphingosine-based ceramide, which when included in skin care formulas, helps skin produce more of its own ceramides. This helps skin better retain its moisture, while simultaneously strengthening its barrier against external stimuli. In general, ceramides work best when they’re combined with other replenishing ingredients like fatty acids and cholesterol. These lipid mixtures work in multiple ways to improve skin’s texture, suppleness, and help calm signs of sensitivity. Indeed, ceramides play a critical role in maintaining healthy skin. Ceramide NS can be derived from various sources both synthetic and natural, including yeast. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel’s 2020 assessment concluded that ceramide ingredients are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use. Their survey data looked at personal care products containing concentrations between 0.001-0.006% of ceramide NS. This is a good example of how a seemingly low concentration of an ingredient can still have a noticeable effect on skin."
Ceramides,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Emollient","Major components of skin’s outer layers | Help improve barrier strength, hydration, and suppleness | Work best when combined with other replenishing ingredients","Ceramides are naturally occurring, long chains of lipids (fats) that are major components of skin’s outer layers. In fact, the composition of healthy skin is made up of approximately 50% ceramides. Think of them as the mortar between your skin cells, forming a protective layer that limits moisture loss and protects against visible damage from pollution and other environmental stressors. When ceramide levels decrease (due to aging and other factors), skin is more vulnerable to external stimuli and various disorders. As skin care ingredients, ceramides can be derived from plants or bio-identical forms can be created synthetically—both types work effectively (assuming they’re in a well-formulated product). Ceramides are known for their water-retention capacity (think hydration) and adding them to a skin care product helps provide replenishing and restorative benefits. Of note, they help strengthen skin’s barrier and can improve elasticity. Ceramides work best when combined with other replenishing ingredients like fatty acids and cholesterol. These lipid mixtures work in multiple ways to improve skin’s texture, suppleness, and help calm signs of sensitivity. Different classes of ceramides have been identified in skin. Examples of those used in skin care include ceramide AP, ceramide EOP, ceramide NG, ceramide NP, ceramide NS, phytosphingosine, and sphingosine. To one degree or another, all of them play signaling roles that help to keep skin healthy. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel’s 2020 assessment concluded that ceramide ingredients are safe in cosmetics in the present practices of use. Concentrations vary by the individual ceramide, but generally in skin care they’re used in amounts less than 1%, often much lower since it doesn’t take much to obtain ceramide’s numerous benefits."

Research shows that a deficiency of cholesterol in skin can lead to dryness. When cholesterol is applied to skin topically, it plays a replenishing role to support the moisture balance and lipid composition for healthier looking/feeling skin. Reinforcing skin’s outermost layers in this way also helps it resist damage from external stressors (think harmful bacteria, pollutants, etc.). In skin care formulas, cholesterol can also function as a stabilizer, emollient, surfactant, and water-binding agent. Cholesterol-enriched skin care products may list “cholesterol” on the ingredient label. Alternatively, if you see wool extract or lanolin on the ingredient list, know that these are sources of cholesterol as well. In addition, scientists are continually exploring ways to create synthetic ingredients that mimic cholesterol’s skin benefits. The safety of cholesterol in skin care products has been assessed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel, who deemed it was safe in normal cosmetic use (studied in concentrations up to 5%, although they acknowledged most formulations they looked at contained cholesterol in the 0.1-1% range.) As with any natural fatty acid or oil, cholesterol is prone to going rancid with prolonged exposure to light and air so protective packaging is key."

Coffea arabica fruit extract comes from the fleshy “cherry” portion of the coffee plant that contains the seeds (beans). This utilizes the entire fruit profile, not just the beans. As is the case for all plant extracts, the effectiveness of Coffea arabica fruit extract can vary depending on the extraction method and formulation in which it’s used. Coffee extracts often show up in products claiming to minimize puffy eyes, lift skin or reduce cellulite, with implications the caffeine content is responsible for these benefits. However, research continues to be inconclusive with mixed results regarding caffeine’s direct effects on skin. For a deeper dive into the science, see the related ingredient entry for caffeine. Studies have shown that coffee extracts are generally safe for topical application, with the typical use level being 1–6% when in a blend with water and/or glycerin. As with any botanical extract, skin irritation is possible if you have an allergy to this particular ingredient, although such occurrences are rare.

Collagen,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Humectant",Critical component of skin | Protein that provides skin structure | Loss of collagen leads to multiple signs of aging | Functions topically as a humectant,"Collagen is a protein that is a critical component of skin’s extracellular matrix, or ECM. It is the most abundant protein in the human body. Collagen provides structure and support for skin’s basic architecture, in addition to defining cell behaviors and tissue function. Collagen depletion – either through the natural process of growing older or repeated environmental assault – is one of the key factors leading to signs of visible aging. When applied directly to skin, collagen’s largest benefit is as a humectant, binding water to help skin retain moisture. It does not, however, build new collagen. Its high molecular weight means it isn’t able to penetrate skin, and beneath the surface is where it would work optimally to restore skin firmness. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t promote collagen! There are other ingredients, among them key targeted peptides, that help to restore collagen within skin, improving the look and feel of firmness."

When it is used in cosmetics, it goes through a purification process to ensure the end product is simply collagen. Though internally collagen is tasked with maintaining skin’s firmness and elasticity, when applied topically it does not have the same benefit (not even close). This is due to collagen extract’s large molecular weight, which prevents it from penetrating skin’s surface to impact the fibroblasts beneath. This does not mean that collagen extract isn’t skin-beneficial when used in cosmetics. It still functions as an effective humectant, preventing trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL), leaving skin looking refreshed, hydrated, and more supple. Collagen extract is also used as a texture enhancer in some cosmetics preparations. Use levels range from 0.5–5%, depending on the desired formulary goals."

Cyanocobalamin,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant",Synthetic form of Vitamin B12 | Helps relieve sensitive and stressed skin | Protects against skin barrier damage,"Cyanocobalamin is a synthetic form of vitamin B12 (aka cobalamin), an important water-soluble vitamin that the body needs but cannot produce. Within the body, vitamin B12 is involved in red blood cell production, brain and nerve health and DNA synthesis. Naturally found in liver, oily fish, eggs and dairy products, this vitamin is also and most often used in oral supplements to treat vitamin deficiencies. Some foods, such as breads and cereals, are fortified with this essential nutrient. Vitamin B12 levels are linked to skin, hair, and nail health; indeed, people who have B12 deficiencies — or sometimes excess levels of this vitamin — can experience health complications, including acne. For skin, both oral and topical cyanocobalamin have been used to help prevent or reduce the occurrence of dermatological conditions such as atopic dermatitis and psoriasis, because of this vitamin’s ability to counter factors within skin that cause signs of irritation, especially for people with dry, itchy, or scaly skin. Studies from a major supplier of this ingredient in cosmetics plus additional independent research have shined a light on vitamin B12’s helpful role in defending skin from external stressors (including UV light) and supporting the skin’s microbiome. However, more research needs to be completed and this ingredient is not an approved UV active. Commercial vitamin B12 is mainly produced through bacterial fermentation. Use levels of cyanocobalamin in cosmetics typically range from 0.5–5%."
Daidzein,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",A type of antioxidant known as an isoflavone found in soybeans | Pronounced ability to help skin better withstand environmental exposure | Improves signs of aging and texture changes coinciding with estrogen decline | Helps improve skin’s natural content of hyaluronic acid,"Daidzein is one of the primary isoflavone antioxidants found naturally in soy, although lesser amounts occur in other foods such as nuts, grapes, and cabbage. Research on human skin has shown it helps mitigate the cascade of oxidative and other damage triggered by exposure to UVB light. Indeed, one study showed daidzein reduced this damage by 71%! This also makes it a good soothing ingredient since it helps offset the multi-layer irritation UV light causes. This soy isoflavone has been shown to have protective benefits for skin’s underlying support, helping to maintain the look and feel of youthful firmness instead of leaving age-related deterioration unchecked. Daidzein is absorbed well, but research has shown its “sister” isoflavone genistein has better absorption; however, studies have also shown that combining daidzein and genistein offers greater benefits due to their natural affinity for skin and the distinctive benefits each provides. Research has also shown daidzein is more effective topically when formulated in a skin-friendly delivery system such as complex sugars known as cyclodextrins. Daidzein is considered safe and non-irritating as used in skin care, where amounts range from 0.02%–0.5% when used in pure form (rather than what naturally occurs in soy extracts)."

It also goes by the name carcinine. In skin care, it’s most well-known for acting as an antioxidant, where it can help ward off the negative impacts environmental stressors have on skin. Suppliers of this ingredient tout its collagen-boosting benefits. At the time of this review, there isn’t enough peer-reviewed published research on decarboxy carnosine HCL to confirm that benefit, but it does look promising in terms of antiglycation effects. (Glycation is a process that impairs skin’s collagen and elastin, so inhibiting it is a good thing.) Because this ingredient is a derivative of carnosine, it is believed to offer many of the same anti-aging benefits. Carnosine is a lab-engineered peptide that also occurs naturally in the body and plays a role in maintaining skin and bodily health."
Diethylamino Hydroxybenzoyl Hexyl Benzoate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters","Synthetic sunscreen agent that helps shield skin against UVA rays | Approved as UV filter in many global markets but not in the U.S. | Protects skin from sun damage that could otherwise accelerate visible signs of aging | An oil-soluble, white-to-light-salmon colored granular powder in raw material form | Noted for excellent photostability","Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate is a synthetic sunscreen agent that helps shield skin against UVA rays with peak absorption at 354 nm (the UVA range extends to 400 nm). Currently it is not an FDA-approved sunscreen agent in the United States; however, it is an approved UV filter in many other markets, including the European Union, China, Australia, and Japan at a 10% maximum concentration. Suppliers of this ingredient and research studies indicate that diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate offers excellent photostability. It is considered superior to avobenzone (another popular UVA spectrum sunscreen agent) in this regard and can be used alone or in tandem with other UV absorbers. It’s important to know, however, that avobenzone’s stability disadvantage can be overcome by several methods, making it a very effective UVA absorber. Diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate is lipophilic, meaning it is soluble in oils/fats/lipids, which positively impacts this ingredient’s affinity for the epidermis, since this layer of skin contains natural lipids. Due to its role of protecting skin from damaging UVA rays that accelerate signs of aging, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate can be considered an anti-aging ingredient. This type of radiation is present all day long, and penetrates deeply into skin, where it causes a cascade of damage that leads to many signs of aging, such as coarse wrinkles and loss of firmness. In raw material form, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate’s appearance is described as a white to light salmon colored granular powder. Due to its oil-soluble nature, diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate must be incorporated in the oil phase of emulsions. In 2008, the European Commission for Health & Consumer Protection submitted their opinion on the safety of diethylamino hydroxybenzoyl hexyl benzoate. Their Scientific Committee on Consumer Products report deemed it does not pose a risk to the health of the consumer at a maximum concentration of 10%."
Diglycerin,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Solvent",Humectant that boosts hydration within skin | Can also be used as a solvent or to improve foaming properties of a formula | Related to glycerin but noted as less sticky | May offer longer-lasting hydration than glycerin due to its higher molecular weight,"Diglycerin is a highly beneficial ingredient for individuals with dry or dehydrated skin, thanks to its humectant properties that enhance water retention within the skin. Besides its moisturizing capabilities, diglycerin serves as an effective solvent and can improve the viscosity of foam in personal care products. You can find this versatile ingredient in various products such as cleansers, lotions, shaving creams, shampoos, and makeup items. Created by bonding two glycerin molecules together, diglycerin suppliers claim it provides longer-lasting hydration compared to glycerin, owing to its higher molecular weight, which slows down penetration and allows it to remain on the skin for an extended period. Additionally, diglycerin is less sticky than glycerin, contributing to a more aesthetically pleasing user experience. That said, cosmetic chemists familiar with glycerin’s aesthetic drawbacks know how to combine it with other ingredients, such as dimethicone, for an improved sensorial experience. While the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) has not yet finalized their safety report on diglycerin, it is helpful to note that previous assessments for glycerin by the CIR concluded it as safe for cosmetic use. As of 2022, the highest reported concentration of diglycerin usage was 28% in skin cleansing products and up to 5% in non-spray face and neck products. In its raw form, diglycerin is a colorless to slightly yellow viscous liquid at room temperature."

It is one of the most frequently used emollient (softening) ingredients in moisturizers, well known for its gentleness and effectiveness. Dimethicone is recognized as a “skin protectant” by the U.S. FDA, when used in over-the-counter products in concentrations of 1-30%. It forms an air-permeable barrier that works to prevent moisture loss, so skin better retains hydration, while still allowing natural perspiration to evaporate. It imparts a wonderfully silky (but not greasy) feel, which makes it especially popular in oil-free moisturizers. Dimethicone may also be used with other ingredients such as alumina to coat zinc oxide or titanium dioxide in sunscreen formulation to help the actives distribute evenly on skin, providing uniform protection. Dimethicone is considered a synthetic ingredient, even though it’s derived from natural silicon. It has a long track record of being recognized as safe in cosmetic products."
Dimethylmethoxy Chromanol,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant",Synthetic molecule that’s analog to vitamin E | Supplies impressive antioxidant properties tied to its potency | Helps to keep skin youthful-looking | Contributes to an even skin tone,"Dimethylmethoxy chromanol (DMC) is a synthetically created potent skin care ingredient and antioxidant. It was purposely made to be structurally similar to vitamin E, even though it expands on that vitamin’s protective abilities. DMC is also often referred to by its trade name, Lipochroman-6. Specifically created for enhanced efficacy, DMC delivers such great antioxidant ability that it’s only recommended for usage in percentages between 0.01% and 0.05%. Protection from environmental agents and the inhibition of pro-aging damage associated with these agents is DMC’s main benefit. Research proves this ingredient clears away unwanted cellular debris and helps alleviate damage from pollution, UV rays and other aggressors. Through the mitigation of this damage, DMC can reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles and help maintain the skin’s architecture, keeping it feeling tight and looking youthful. DMC’s also helps even out skin tone as it tackles dark spots and spots associated with external damage. Due to its antioxidant benefits, DMC features in some sunscreen formulas to help fortify and provide an added layer of UV ray damage mitigation. As a raw material, this skin care ingredient appears as a light yellow to brown powder."
Dipalmitoyl Hydroxyproline,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Peptides",An oil-soluble derivative of hydroxyproline | Hydroxyproline is the primary amino acid in skin’s collagen | Helps preserve skin’s supportive elements | The palmitoyl portion comes from hydrating palmitic acid,"Dipalmitoyl hydroxyproline is an oil-soluble version of hydroxyproline, which is the primary amino acid in collagen. Making it oil-soluble improves penetration into skin and lips, where it works to signal skin from the uppermost layers to repair its supportive elements, leading to fewer visible lines and wrinkles. In essence, hydroxyproline is considered a signal peptide. This ingredient works best when paired with oils or glycols since both increase its affinity for skin. Along with supporting skin’s collagen, it also offsets collagen-degrading enzymes known as matrix metalloproteinases. When these enzymes proliferate unchecked, collagen is weakened, leading to signs of sagging and thinning lips. The recommended usage level of dipalmitoyl hydroxyproline is 0.1-2%; clinical studies from suppliers have shown measurable improvement of wrinkle depth when used at 0.5%. Palmitic acid is considered safe for skin, as are proline and hydroxyproline since the latter two are found naturally in skin and its collagen."

Studies from one ingredient supplier indicate that this peptide as part of a blend may reduce the look of puffy eyes; however, to date independent research hasn’t supported this claim. Generally, dipeptide-2 is considered a skin conditioning ingredient whose smaller size allows it to easily penetrate skin’s uppermost layers where it can assist with skin renewal and replenishment. For now, that’s the most compelling reason to consider skin care products that contain it. Recommended usage levels on this peptide by itself aren’t available; however, usage levels when this peptide is part of a blend range from 0.5–5%, depending on desired results."
Dipotassium Glycyrrhizate,Best,Soothing,"Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",Derived from licorice | Has antioxidant benefits | Strong anti-inflammatory properties | Ruled safe as used in cosmetics | Pale yellow to off-white powder in its raw form,"Dipotassium glycyrrhizate is a potassium salt of glycyrrhizic acid, a soothing compound derived from the roots of the licorice (_Glycyrrhiza glabra_) plant. As with other parts of licorice, it has well-established antioxidant benefits. As alluded to above, along with its ability to fight signs of aging caused by oxidative stress, dipotassium glycyrrhizate is known for its potent anti-inflammatory properties, making it an excellent addition to skin care products design to soothe skin irritation and calm signs of redness. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled dipotassium glycyrrhizate safe as used in cosmetics. In its raw form it is a pale yellow to off-white powder. One interesting factoid is that because of its naturally mild sweet taste, dipotassium glycyrrhizate is also used as a flavoring agent. Typical use levels of dipotassium glycyrrhizate in cosmetics is 0.1–0.5%; however, some suppliers recommend up to 2% depending on formulary goals."

Since its UVA protection peaks at 340 nanometers, it’s generally best to see this combined with other UV filters whose protection peaks further along the UVA range, which goes up to 400 nanometers. Research has found that allergic reactions to drometrizole trisiloxane are considered rare; this UV filter is used in sun protection products sold in the EU, Canada, Australia, and Japan. It is not currently in wide use in the United States because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration says there is not significant evidence yet showing it to be generally recognized as safe and effective for over-the-counter sunscreen use.

It’s sometimes referred to as purple viper’s-bugloss. In particular, it’s a very good source the omega-3 fatty acid linolenic acid plus an omega-3 precursor fatty acid known as stearidonic acid. These compounds help repair and strengthen skin’s moisture barrier, in turn making skin less sensitive to external aggressors. The oil expressed from the seeds of this plant is also rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E and caffeic acid. Due to the inherent instability of the oil in the presence of heat, cold or non-heat solvent extraction methods should be utilized. Citric and ascorbic acids as well as sunflower oil have proven to bolster the oil’s stability. Usage levels for this plant oil vary and there are no restrictions on how much can be used in a cosmetic; for example, a brand could offer a 100% pure oil for topical use (it’s also marketed as an omega fatty acid supplement). Typical usage levels in cosmetics range from 1–5%, depending on formulary goals."

It serves as an emollient on skin and can also have a buffering and anti-pollution effect in cosmetics. Chemically, ectoin is considered an osmolyte and extremolyte (something capable of living in extreme conditions, like Keith Richards). What that means for skin is that as an osmolyte, ectoin helps maintain balanced hydration by maintaining the correct water balance in skin. In studies, this amino acid derivative exhibited the ability to reduce transepidermal water loss across all facial areas. Through the reduction of moisture loss and the promotion of a correct, healthy water balance ectoin allowed skin to better maintain its hydration and a smooth, soft surface. Mounting research indicates ectoin can also help protect skin from environmental stressors related to different types of natural light, specifically UVA rays (although to be very clear ectoin is not a sunscreen), and pollutants. This protective ability helps thwart pro-aging damage that external factors can have on skin. It’s believed ectoin exhibits these benefits in part because of its antioxidant ability as well as what seems to be a natural ability to protect skin from dehydration due to environmental exposure. Although more research is needed for substantiation, new studies also credit ectoin with the ability to interrupt the formation of dark spots, visibly improve the look of pores, support a healthy skin barrier and soothe. Cosmetic ingredient suppliers suggest using ectoin in percentages between 0.3%-2.0%. It’s a white crystalline powder in raw material form."

Elaeis Guineensis Oil,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",Also called palm oil | Contains antioxidant beta-carotene + vitamin E | Rich in fatty acids | Ruled safe as used in cosmetics,"Elaeis guineensis oil, also called palm oil or palm kernel oil, is the oil extracted from the seeds of a tree known as the African palm. This tree is more abundant in oil than any other natural source (including olives and sunflowers) and the oil has numerous commercial applications – from a hair conditioning ingredient to a biofuel and almost everything in between. When it comes specifically to skin, palm oil offers a high amount of antioxidants beta-carotene and vitamin E, making it a good anti-aging ingredient because of its ability to fight free-radical damage. Perhaps its greatest strength though is in its rich fatty acid content (including oleic and ceramide-building linoleic acids) that provide lasting hydration and improve the strength of skin’s barrier. Recently, and for many reasons, commercial methods of producing palm oil have come under scrutiny. A primary reason is that Elaeis guineensis is a high-yield cash crop with a rapid growth rate. As such, areas of native plants have been razed to satisfy the global demand for palm trees, leading to deforestation. It’s a case of agriculture vs. biodiversity, although there’s still much to discover as this issue unfolds. In response, many brands are now seeking sustainable sources of palm oil to use in their products to reverse this trend. Paula’s Choice Skincare’s parent company, Unilever, is one of these brands. You can find more about its policy on the sustainable use of palm oil at this link: https://www.unilever.com/sustainability/nature/sustainable-palm-oil/.

It works on skin’s surface by neutralizing numerous types of damaging molecules known as free radicals that would otherwise go on to impair collagen-producing cells known as fibroblasts, which are present in skin’s lower layer. Engelhardtia chrysolepsis also can help interrupt a process known as glycation, in which rogue sugar molecules attack and weaken skin’s surface lipids, impairing its barrier and eventually impacting skin’s underlying support. This makes it a particularly valuable ingredient for those looking to maintain resiliency, a lifted look and generally help skin maintain a more youthful appearance. Astilbin, one of the soothing antioxidants in this plant, has been shown to improve the adhesion of tight junction proteins on skin’s surface, a benefit which strengthens skin’s barrier, helping it resist water loss. Usage levels in cosmetics is 3% when present in a blend with butylene glycol. The plant itself works beautifully in amounts much lower than that, 0.03%. There are no safety or irritancy concerns for this ingredient, although as with any plant extract, an allergic reaction, while unlikely, is possible."
Ensulizole,Best,,UV Filters,,"Also known as phenylbenzimidazole sulfonic acid, ensulizole is a water soluble sunscreen ingredient that works in the UVB range, offering no UVA protection. For this reason, ensulizole should always be paired with one or more UVA-screening sunscreen actives in any SPF-rated product labeled “broad spectrum”. There’s some controversy in the research about what some refer to as ensulizole potentially being a “double-edged sword” for skin. Studies on fish scales and bat skin have shown it protects against oxidizing molecules generated by UVB exposure but it can also trigger DNA damage within skin. Although this hasn’t shown to be true on human skin, it may at least partially explain why ensulizole is not commonly found in sunscreens, despite having very few reports of triggering allergic reactions on human skin. Aesthetically, ensulizole feels lighter and less oily than most synthetic sunscreen actives, so is sometimes chosen when the goal is a very lightweight texture, although the mineral actives titanium dioxide and zinc oxide can also feel surprisingly light on skin. Ensulizole concentrations up to 4% are approved for use in sunscreens sold in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, and Korea. In most other parts of the world, ensulizole concentrations up to 8% are permitted, with the exception of Japan, whose maximum permitted amount is 3%. Along with protecting skin from UVB damage, ensulizole or its salts are sometimes included in cosmetics whose clear packaging would otherwise allow the formula inside to discolor due to ongoing light exposure. Salt forms of ensulizole include potassium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate, sodium phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate and TEA-phenylbenzimidazole sulfonate. This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing."

The bark, seeds, stems, and leaves are sources of polyphenolic antioxidant compounds shown to help bolster skin’s environmental defenses, particularly in the presence of UV light. Chemical analysis revealed the bark is a richer source of these antioxidants. The antioxidants help reduce the visible effects of inflammatory substances generated in skin exposed to sunlight. One of the major components in Entada phaseoloides bark/seed extract are saponins which, in high amounts, can have *gentle cleansing properties. The pronounced soothing effect of this plant extract also plays a role in helping skin recover from damage, relieving dry, tight sensations and helping skin return to a healthier look and feel. Seeds from this plant are rich sources of amino acids, fatty acids such as oleic and linoleic, and hydrating saccharides. Use levels of Entada phaseoloides bark/seed extract in skin care are 1.5–4% when supplied as part of a blend that also contains glycol and water. It is an interesting ingredient to use in daytime products such as sunscreens. *At the time of this writing, we’re unaware of any cosmetics whose content of _Entada phaseoloides_ bark/seed extract is high enough for it to function as a cleansing agent."

It is the chief catechin in green tea and believed to be responsible for many of its health benefits. There are numerous studies showing its positive impact on health when ingested, including the improvement of vascular symptoms. When applied topically, research shows that EGCG has soothing properties, as well as the ability to protect skin from sun damage (though it is not a replacement for daily use of a sunscreen rated SPF 30 or higher). Because of its potent antioxidant capabilities, it is considered an excellent anti-aging ingredient, with the ability to help skin both look and act younger. EGCG shows promising potential as a skin-protective agent, particularly against UV-induced damage and photoaging. Its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and collagen-preserving properties make it a valuable ingredient in skincare formulations aimed at maintaining skin health and preventing premature aging.

It’s well known in folk medicinefor its soothing properties and has been used topically for centuries to treat rashes, burns, and other skin ailments. As it turns out, the traditional foundation for this application is solid: modern research demonstrates fireweed extract is an excellent addition to skin care. Fireweed contains an abundance of antioxidant polyphenols, is a source of l-ascorbic acid (pure vitamin C), and contains fatty acids, among them oleic and palmitic acids. These antioxidant and moisturizing properties give the extract a wealth of anti-aging benefits. In addition, studies show Epilobium angustifolium extract has strong anti-inflammatory properties (mainly from its polyphenol content), giving it value in skin care preparations designed to soothe skin or tamp down redness. Typically supplied in a water base, Epilobium angustifolium extract’s use level in cosmetics hovers between 0.5–1.5%. If used in more concentrated powder form, the use level would drop to 0.1% or less. In short, Epilobium angustifolium extract is a multifaceted ingredient that is a welcome addition to any skin care product!

Equol,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",A potent antioxidant that’s a by-product of soy isoflavone daidzein | Oil-soluble nature makes it highly bioavailable to skin | Interrupts pathways in skin’s surface that lead to loss of density and suppleness | Connects with specific receptor sites on skin’s surface to send healthy messages,"Equol is a metabolite (by-product) of the soy-derived isoflavone ingredient daidzein. It is a potent antioxidant, with comparative studies showing it has superior free radical-scavenging abilities when measured against vitamins C, E, astaxanthin and quercetin. This doesn’t mean equol is the best antioxidant, but it’s encouraging news for environmentally vulnerable skin, such as occurs with advancing age. In essence, equol helps strengthen skin so it’s better able to resist signs of aging. One of the ways equol is believed to work so well as an antioxidant is that it plays a role in interrupting multiple steps in what researchers describe as a cascade of oxidative damage. Equol also helps skin build up its own antioxidant defense system which ordinarily weakens with age and sun damage. All of this also has a pronounced soothing effect on skin’s surface, visibly calming irritated skin. There are two types of equol, known as R-equol and S-equol. The type of equol most often used in skin care is known as racemic equol, meaning it is an even mix of both types. This is the type of equol that has the most research supporting topical application and is considered more effective. Equol is an oil-soluble antioxidant that research has shown is highly bioavailable to skin, where it connects with specific receptor sites on skin’s surface. From here, it helps signal skin to look younger and smoother. Effective concentrations of equol in skin care are between 0.3–0.5%. Equol is considered safe for topical use since its parent compound daidzein has a long history of safe use in foods people routinely eat, such as soy (except the oil), dairy products (from cows fed a soy-rich diet), cabbage, nuts, grapefruit, grapes/raisins, and currants. The digestive process breaks down isoflavone daidzein to form s-equol, which has wide-ranging health benefits in the body."
Ergothioneine,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Antioxidant",Helps skin look younger in multiple ways | Helps fade signs of discoloration | Offers soothing benefits,"Ergothioneine is a derivative of the amino acid histidine synthesized in nature by various bacteria and fungi. It occurs in most types of mushrooms with naturally high amounts detected in oyster, porcini, portobello, white button and shiitake types. Red beans, black beans, garlic and oat bran are other food sources, but a bio-identical form can be lab-synthesized and has proven to be safe. Several studies have shown that ergothioneine is a potent antioxidant, capable of helping skin look younger when exposed to environmental stressors and sources of oxidative damage. One of the ways ergothioneine works on skin is by helping to protect its endogenous (naturally occurring) antioxidants from degrading, thus enabling it to maintain its defenses for longer periods of time. Ergothioneine also has a surface inhibitory effect on an enzyme that plays a role in fueling excess melanin within skin’s uppermost layers. In doing so, ergothioneine plays a supporting role helping to fade discolorations. Usage levels of ergothioneine in skin care range from 0.1–1% when supplied in a water-based solution with the antioxidant having an activity level of 0.05%--a testimony to this ingredient’s impressive potency."

The manufacturer of this ingredient states that the metabolites, especially threonate, increase the effectiveness of the vitamin C in the product. However, this study has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. There is a small, in vitro study that supports the notion that Ester-C is more potent than ascorbic acid by itself."
Ethylhexyl Methoxycinnamate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",,"Ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate is a sunscreen agent used to protect skin primarily from the sun’s UVB rays. This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing."
Ethylhexyl Olivate,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent","Natural emollient of skin-conditioning fatty acids derived from olive oil | Helps keep vital hydrating substances in skin from escaping | Delivers a non-greasy after feel that leaves skin and hair soft | Enhances spreadability of creams, lotions, etc.","Ethylhexyl olivate is an olive-derived emollient. More specifically, it is the natural ester of skin-conditioning fatty acids derived from olive oil. It can have an occlusive effect on skin, but that does not mean skin is suffocating; rather, the occlusive nature helps keep vital hydrating substances in skin from escaping, such as can occur in a dry (arid) environment. Suppliers of ethylhexyl olivate describe it as being a low-viscosity emollient (colorless, odorless liquid) with a dry, non-tacky after feel that leaves skin and hair soft. It’s also touted as enhancing the spreadability of formulas and providing a protective film for hair. This ingredient is often positioned as an alternative to silicone ingredients for those seeking such. Ethylhexyl olivate has been deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel and does not have concentration limits."
Ethylhexyl Salicylate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",Globally approved sunscreen agent that works primarily in the UVB range | Commonly known as octisalate | Helps neutralize the sun-induced formation of oxygen radicals | Improves the stability of UV filters like oxybenzone and avobenzone,"Ethylhexyl salicylate is a synthetic sunscreen ingredient that works primarily in the range of UVB light, although it offers a small amount of UVA protection. It is also known as octyl salicylate and octisalate. Research has shown this UV filter can neutralize singlet oxygen, a type of skin-damaging free radical generated by exposure to UVB light. This globally used sunscreen ingredient is approved in varying concentrations around the world, with 5% being the typical maximum amount when combined with other UV filters. Combining ethylhexyl salicylate with other UV filters is necessary since it doesn’t provide sufficient broad-spectrum protection on its own. It is known to improve the stability of other UV filters like oxybenzone and avobenzone. Ethylhexyl salicylate is described as a colorless liquid in raw material form. Ethylhexyl salicylate has been deemed safe as used in cosmetics (by the Personal Care Council Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel) and is not considered an eye or skin irritant.

Ethylhexyl Triazone,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",Synthetic UV filter that helps protect skin against UVB rays | Not approved in the United States and Canada but available in other markets around the world | Used in up to 5% concentration | Also functions as a photostabilizer for other UV filters such as avobenzone | Favorable in water-resistant formulations,"Ethylhexyl triazone is a synthetic sunscreen ingredient known for excellent ability to help protect skin from UVB rays. It is not currently approved as a sunscreen agent in the United States and Canada but is available in other markets in up to 5% concentration. Ethylhexyl triazone offers peak protection at 314nm within the UVB spectrum. As such, it must be combined with other sunscreen agents to achieve optimal broad spectrum protection. It helps boost the photostability of other UV filters such as avobenzone. Ethylhexyl triazone’s insolubility in water makes it favorable in water-resistant formulations. On the flip side, it can be difficult to formulate with in water-based formulas; however, chemists have found ways to work around this by developing unique delivery systems, including encapsulation methods. Of note, researchers point out ethylhexyl triazone’s high molecular weight (823.07 g mol−1) limits its penetration. This is a good thing as you want your sunscreen ingredients to remain in the uppermost layers of skin where they can best provide a first line of defense against damaging UV rays. Limiting penetration of UV filters like this also reduces the risk of experiencing a sensitized reaction. Ethylhexyl triazone comes as a white to off white powder in its raw material form."

Ferulic Acid,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Helps defend skin from signs of sun damage | Improves stability + efficacy of other antioxidants | Can help fight discolorations,"Ferulic acid is a phenolic antioxidant (a type that intercepts damaging hydrogen radicals) that is naturally found in bran and bamboo shoots, among other plants. Research has shown that it provides its own benefits to skin while also enhancing the stability of other antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, when paired with them. Of note, ferulic acid plays a significant photoprotective role, which is one of the reasons it’s a welcome addition in sunscreen formulations. In Japan, ferulic acid is approved as a sunscreen active up to 10%. Research also indicates that it has the ability to inhibit certain triggers of skin discolorations, making ferulic acid a nice complement to products that are intended for evening skin tone. In general, it also helps defend skin against environmental assault. Ferulic acid can be used in the types of high concentration chemical peels available in a dermatologist/esthetician setting, where it is usually combined with other acids, such as lactic, to address signs of photoaging. Ferulic acid’s soothing properties are believed to help reduce potential skin-irritating side effects of such peels. As a raw material, ferulic acid comes as a crystalline powder that is insoluble in water at room temperature but reaches solubility in higher water temps. It is also soluble in other types of solvents. Ferulic acid is shown to be most effective at boosting the results from other antioxidants when used in concentrations of 0.5% or greater. It is typically not used above 1%, as doing so can impart an undesirable color to a skin care formula."
Ficus Carica (Fig) Fruit Extract,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Emollient",,"Fig may seem like a simple fruit often associated with the soft-textured cookies sold in grocery stores; however, it is proving to be a rather fascinating ingredient for skin. It’s a rich source of a class of antioxidants known as phenolic compounds, including gallic acid, various epicatechins, and anthocyanins which contribute to the rich, often dark color of fig skin and the fruit inside. Along with being an antioxidant, fig has been shown to enhance skin’s hydration by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. It can also visibly improve skin color by addressing an enzyme in skin (tyrosinase) whose overproduction can lead to dark spots. Those benefits are intriguing, but there’s more: fig extract has also been to help reduce uncomfortably dry, tight skin, including compromised, redness-prone skin. One caution: Fig contains a group of naturally-occurring compounds known as psoralens. These can make skin more sensitive to sun exposure, but you can get around this by using a broad spectrum sunscreen every day. The leaves, root and sap from the fig plant contain the highest concentration of psoralens, which is why the fruit portion, which contains appreciably low levels, is typically used in skin care."

In vitro research has shown glucomannan works with a wide range of probiotics to help control the proliferation of acne-causing bacteria on skin. It also has antioxidant ability, which isn’t too surprising given glucomannan comes from a plant. Glucomannan is also a food ingredient, such as konjac flour. Research has documented its contribution to health benefits, such as weight management and controlling glucose levels in the body."
Gluconolactone,Best,"Evens Skin Tone, Anti-Aging, Hydration","Evens Skin Tone, Anti-Aging, Hydration, Exfoliant",,"Gluconolactone is a type of polyhydroxy acid, or PHA. PHAs are supposed to be as effective as AHAs, but less sensitizing. Gluconolactone is chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between it and AHAs is that gluconolactone has a larger molecular structure, which limits its ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for sensitizing side-effects. Supposedly, this reduced absorption into the skin does not hamper their effectiveness. Does that mean gluconolactone is better for your skin than AHAs in the form of glycolic acid or lactic acid? According to an Internet-published class lecture by Dr. Mark G. Rubin, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, research on gluconolactone demonstrated only a “6% decrease in dermal penetration” in comparison to glycolic acid, which “isn’t a dramatic improvement.” Gluconolactone may be slightly less sensitizing for some skin types, but this isn’t the magic bullet for exfoliation some cosmetics companies have been extolling. Polyhydroxy acids can also function as antioxidants and may promote some amount of improvement in skin’s surface strength."

It offers a multitude of benefits for skin, including moisture retention and refining rough texture, which helps promote a more even skin tone. It has an excellent safety profile, as last assessed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel in 2022. For cosmetics, derivatives of glucosamine tend to be used more often than the original form due to greater stability, bioavailability, and ease of formulation. Examples include plant-derived glucosamine HCI (the hydrochloride form) or acetyl glucosamine, which pairs well with niacinamide for further improvement in the appearance of dark spots and uneven tone. Use levels of glucosamine and derivatives in cosmetics ranges from 0.5–5%. Getting a bit more science-y, despite glucosamine’s smaller molecular size, it has poor transdermal absorption because of its polarity and hydrosolubility. As such, formulation techniques to improve delivery are essential for skin permeation of this amino acid sugar."

Glucosyl ceramide is composed of a ceramide and sugar molecule known as glucose. This ingredient is responsible for the healthy formation and appearance of skin’s upper layers, known as the epidermis, and is the primary glycosphingolipid in this portion of the skin. Research has shown that oral consumption of glucosyl ceramides, whether from wheat, corn, rice bran, beets, or konjac root can make it from the digestion process to skin. Interestingly (but not too surprising) research has also shown that glucosyl ceramides have less benefit for normal skin than they do for dry, sun-damaged, or otherwise compromised skin. Plant-derived glucosyl ceramides can visibly repair and strengthen skin’s barrier, improve hydration channels in skin, and interrupt factors in skin that trigger signs of sensitivity, dryness, and dullness. In short, glucosyl ceramides are proving to be an integral ingredient for healthier skin at any age, and nicely complement a range of ceramides used in topical skin care products."
Glucosyl Hesperidin,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Synthetic water-soluble form of the flavonoid hesperidin | Has antioxidant properties + can improve barrier function | Has skin-soothing benefits | Some research shows it can improve the appearance of uneven skin tone,"Glucosyl hesperidin is a water-soluble form of hesperidin, a flavonoid found in many citrus plants, as well as in evening primrose oil. Whereas hesperidin is natural, glycosyl hesperidin is synthetic. Its water solubility means it is more readily absorbed by the skin. Research shows hesperidin has antioxidant properties and when applied topically, can help improve skin’s barrier function. There are also studies showing it has skin-soothing benefits and that it can improve the appearance of uneven skin tone. Aside from its skin care use, glucosyl hesperidin is also used as a food additive and has been determined “generally ruled as safe” (GRAS) by the United States Food & Drug Administration."

The gradual decline of the natural supply of glutathione in the body is believed to be a key marker of many outward signs of aging. Glutathione is a tripeptide comprised of three amino acids (cysteine, glutamic acid, and glycine), which work in unison when used topically to brighten a dull complexion while offering skin-restoring benefits. It has value for visibly fading discolorations when used in a 2% concentration due to its ability to interrupt an enzyme within skin’s surface that triggers hyperpigmentation. Glutathione has also been shown to help stabilize and enhance the performance of other antioxidants such as vitamin C, even when used in low concentrations."

Glycerin is a skin-replenishing and skin-restoring ingredient, meaning it is a substance found naturally in skin, helping to establish normal balance and hydration. It’s one of the many substances in skin that helps maintain a healthy look and feel, defending against dryness and working to maintain skin’s moisture level. Essentially, glycerin is a master at hydration, and works best when combined with other replenishing and emollient ingredients. Some people wonder whether using products with glycerin takes too much water from skin when there isn’t enough humidity in the air. This can occur with pure glycerin (that is, at a 100% concentration - an amount that’s never used in skin care products). Any humectant (including glycerin) used in pure form can increase water loss by attracting water from the lower layers of skin into the surface layers when the climate is too arid (low humidity). For this reason, glycerin and humectants are typically used in concentrations of 5% or less and always combined with other ingredients to soften skin.

This compound is considered more stable and offers formulary flexibility because it isn’t beholden to the same narrow pH range for efficacy compared to pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid). This form shares many of the same benefits as regular vitamin C, including being an antioxidant, improving skin tone, helping to fade hyperpigmentation and post-breakout marks, and supporting skin’s firmness. A derivative of glyceryl ascorbate known as 3-O-Laurylglyceryl ascorbate (VC-3LG) has been shown to improve ceramide synthesis in skin which in turn helps strengthen skin’s surface against moisture loss. VC-3LG is also a formidable antioxidant and can help improve skin’s natural antioxidant defenses. Interestingly, although glyceryl ascorbate and its derivatives are very good antioxidants, they’re considered less potent than ascorbic acid, which is less stable in the presence of light and air. This is likely due to the molecular changes necessary to create vitamin C derivatives. There’s a trade-off between greater stability and reduced antioxidant potential. Concentration range of glyceryl ascorbate in skin care is between 1-10%; however, there are no studies showing which percentages are needed for results on discolorations, wrinkles, or skin tone improvement. Instead, some studies imply that the concentrations for such benefits are comparable to pure vitamin C."

Its made by cross-reacting glycerin with glucose. It not only draws and hold water within skin’s surface layers, it interacts with water-transport channels (known as aquaporins) in skin’s surface to ensure balanced hydration. The glucose portion of this ingredient plays a role in boosting skin’s enzymatic antioxidants, which improves skin’s environmental defenses. This includes reducing skin’s tendency to become dehydrated. Recommended usage levels of glyceryl glucoside in skin care range from 0.5–2%. Since it’s composed of ingredients that occur naturally in skin, it is considered safe and non-irritating as used in cosmetics."

Though there are some genetic differences between the two varieties, Glycine max oil shares many of the same benefits of Glycine soja oil. In addition to the antioxidant properties most plant oils have, Glycine max oil contains fatty acids – among the linoleic, oleic, and linolenic acids – which help restore skin’s natural moisturizing factor and shore up its barrier. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has deemed several components of the Glycine max (soybean) plant safe as used in cosmetics, as well as the oil of the related Glycine soja , though it has not ruled specifically on Glycine max oil yet."

Chief among them are daidzein and genistein, both known as phytoestrogens due to their molecular similarity to estrogen. It’s important to note that phytoestrogen compounds are not hormones and are widely considered safe for topical use. Among other antioxidants found in soybean seeds are quercetin plus syringic, ferulic, and sinapic acids, all of which play role in defending skin from environmental aggressors that hinder its appearance. Some of the antioxidants in soy, particularly genistein and daidzein, have considerable research supporting their benefits for visibly reducing signs of aging due to sun damage as well as the visible consequences of estrogen loss, such as skin becoming thinner and developing a crepe-like texture. These antioxidants are also potent skin soothers and help support skin’s firmness and resiliency, exerting a potent protective influence against skin aging. Taken together, the antioxidant components of Glycine soja (soybean) seed extract work in numerous ways to help skin look younger and maintain a healthy, even-toned appearance. Glycine soja (soybean) seed extract has been reviewed and deemed safe as used in cosmetics. Typical usage levels range from 0.09–3%; however, greater amounts are permitted depending on formulary goals."

As with all plant oils, it has skin-smoothing emollient properties, plus it’s a good source of antioxidants and replenishing fatty acids. Studies have shown that compounds in soy, most likely isoflavones, help fade stubborn discolorations from sun exposure and other sources. They help to reduce excess transfer of melanin to skin’s surface, thereby visibly reducing hyperpigmentation. This is particularly true for the water-soluble Glycine soja seed extract. Soybean oil’s antioxidant content includes polyphenols known as isoflavones, particularly daidzein and genistein. These have been shown to help protect skin from UV light-triggered damage. The antioxidants in soy can also help maintain hydration by preventing water loss. In oil form, soy can help maintain skin’s smooth, supple surface thanks to its blend of fatty acids such as palmitic, stearic, oleic, and linoleic. These fatty acids in the oil plus the naturally-present antioxidants are responsible for the soothing effect soy has in the presence of external aggressors."

Despite the alcohol origin, sterols are not drying on skin; rather, as fatty alcohols, they serve to lubricate and have an emollient texture. In fact, biochemists categorize sterols as lipids (fats) because of how they behave. Sterols can be both animal and plant derived; in the case of plants, they’re also referred to as phytosterols. Glycine soja sterols, in addition to being moisturizing ingredients, are also rich in antioxidants whose free-radical neutralizing ability make them excellent additions to anti-aging skin care products.

While there are several other types of AHA, glycolic acid is by far the one with the most research backing its effectiveness. In its capacity as an exfoliant, it can help shed dead skin to renew skin’s surface, which results in the improvement of several signs of aging, including sun damage, uneven tone, rough, flaky patches of skin, fine lines, and wrinkles. These benefits are obtainable by choosing a leave-on AHA exfoliant that contains 5–10% glycolic acid when it is used as the sole exfoliating acid. It must also be formulated at a pH between 3-4, which is where optimal exfoliation occurs. Studies also show that glycolic acid significantly increases skin’s hydration. It does this by helping skin make substances like mucopolysaccharides, which aid hydration by increasing skin’s natural content of hyaluronic acid, which in turn enhances resilience and improves texture. One exciting new note about glycolic acid: emerging research shows it might even protect skin against UV damage (in addition to reducing its damaging after-effects), though more studies need to be done (and of course it doesn’t replace the need for sunscreen). It’s worth noting that most AHA products do carry a warning about unprotected sun exposure, since the manner in which AHAs exfoliate reveals fresh new skin that can be more susceptible to sun damage. Glycolic acid occurs naturally in sugar cane, but is most effective when synthesized in a lab, where its potency and concentration are optimized for use in skin care. Using plant sugars, like sugar maple, for their glycolic acid content is an option, but the bulk of the reimized for effectiveness, purity, stability, and pH, all critical to getting effective glycolic acid products."

While it’s most famously known for imparting licorice’s signature flavor, it’s also an important ingredient for maintaining healthy skin. Scientific research demonstrates glycyrrhetinic acid has potent antioxidant properties to fight against the ravages of free-radical damage on skin. Recent studies show this acid is particularly effective in staving off the effects of UVB (ultraviolet B)-induced skin damage. As if that weren’t impressive enough, research demonstrates glycyrrhetinic acid also exerts impressive anti-inflammatory effects on skin when applied topically. An indirect but often visible result of this trait is the minimization of dark patches and uneven tone. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled glycyrrhetinic acid safe as used in cosmetics, where it is used in concentrations up to 2%. In fact, amounts even as high as 6% showed no indication of skin sensitization or irritation.

Astaxanthin helps reduce oxidative stress and its resulting damage in skin, thereby offsetting unwanted effects of exposure to the sun, pollutants, etc. Haematococcus pluvialis extract’s reparative qualities make it a welcome addition to anti-aging skin care products and any formulation where healthy skin is the goal. Its soothing effects jibe well with compromised skin. Additionally, Haematococcus pluvialis extract has been studied for its ability to enhance the protection level in sunscreens. In one study, concentrations as low as 0.5% and 1% of astaxanthin extracted from Haematococcus pluvialis significantly increased the SPF value. Another benefit of Haematococcus pluvialis is its fatty acid content, which shows promise for calming environmentally damaged skin. Based on lifecycle stage as well as other conditions (including climate), Haematococcus pluvialis can be either green or red in appearance. The red phase is what produces the astaxanthin content, since astaxanthin is a carotenoid ingredient with a characteristic reddish-orange hue. If this extract sounds familiar to you outside of the cosmetics industry that’s because it’s used in a wide range of other applications, including in the food, beverage, pharmaceutical, and dietary supplement industries. There are no safety concerns for the typical amounts used in cosmetics, which ranges from 0.1–2%."

It’s antioxidant benefits include helping to prevent collagen breakdown, preserving skin’s firmness. Of note, it’s capable of scavenging free radicals that damage skin’s protein and lipid (fat) components, helping to maintain a healthy appearance. It also plays a role in interrupting specific pathways in skin that lead to hyperpigmentation and uneven skin tone, thus improving the uniformity of skin’s surface color. Hexylresorcinol is considered a safe and effective alternative to longstanding dark spot ingredient hydroquinone. Clinical studies have shown excellent synergy of this ingredient paired with the B vitamin niacinamide, various forms of vitamin C and various retinoids. It’s also been shown to be more effective at fading discolorations than kojic acid or licorice extract. Another note on safety: hexylresorcinol has GRAS (Generally Recognized as Safe) status and is also used as a anti-browning agent in foods. Recommended usage levels of hexylresorcinol in skin care range from 0.4–1% when used on its own and 2–4% when this ingredient is part of a blend such as those that contain fatty acids. This ensures the level of hexylresorcinol itself remains in the efficacious range. Note that this ingredient requires an acidic pH (below 6) for best results. The antimicrobial properties of hexylresorcinol give it mild preservative ability when used in levels of 0.1% or greater."

Histidine,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant",An amino acid that provides antioxidant benefits | Is also capable of soothing skin | Alternate name is L-histidine | May be animal-derived or synthetic,"Histidine is an amino acid that has antioxidant and soothing properties for skin. It is a key building block of the skin protein filaggrin, which plays a leading role in maintaining skin’s barrier. Histidine helps keep proteins properly “folded”, which increases their stability and ensures the proteins can do their jobs correctly. Among the amino acids people need to remain healthy, histidine is considered essential since the body cannot make it. As such, people must obtain this nutrient via proteins from foods or supplements. Topically, research has shown histidine is a potent scavenger of the hydroxyl radical, which can cause a cascade of damage on skin’s surface. It also plays a role in helping skin maintain hydration by improving its natural moisturizing factors and ability to withstand environmental damage. Interestingly, deficiencies in histidine are one factor behind skin disorders such as atopic dermatitis. Correcting this can help visibly improve the problem of itchy, dry skin. Histidine maybe derived from protein-rich foods like meat, fish, eggs, soy, beans, nuts and whole grains but may also be synthetic (Paula’s Choice Skincare uses the latter). Usage levels for skin care products range from 0.00009%–0.05%. Its safety for skin has been reviewed and confirmed.

Homosalate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters, Solvent",A globally approved UV filter | Mostly protects within the UVB range | Serves as a solvent for other UV filters | Considered low risk for triggering an allergic reaction | Often seen in sunscreens with higher SPF ratings,"Homosalate is an FDA-approved sunscreen active ingredient that provides primarily UVB protection, stopping where the UVA range begins. It’s internationally approved for use in sunscreens. In the U.S., it is approved for use up to a maximum concentration of 15%. Since the UVA-protecting range of homosalate is very narrow, it’s not used alone in sunscreens, but is often used with UVA filters such as avobenzone, where it can help improve stability. It’s considered non-sensitizing and is most often seen in sunscreens rated SPF 30 and greater. Interestingly, since homosalate is a salicylate ingredient just like salicylic acid, part of how it works to reduce signs of UV-triggered redness is from its calming benefit. Some researchers speculate that this could mean people stay out in the sun longer since they won’t see their skin turn color, but since homosalate is never used alone and the redness-producing damage it offsets is a benefit, it’s not considered a valid concern. Other studies have shown that homosalate suppresses the formation of a type of free radical known as singlet oxygen which is formed when skin is exposed to UV light. Turning to safety, studies have shown that homosalate has low penetration into skin, is not an endocrine disruptor, and is unlikely to provoke an allergic reaction on skin. In vitro studies on breast cancer cells have shown that homosalate has cytotoxic effects; however, this does not apply to how sunscreen is used on skin, and the amounts shown to provoke this effect are much greater than what could be absorbed into the body from topical application. Despite an impressive safety profile, this sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety and toxicology testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing."

They include glycerin, hyaluronic acid, sodium hyaluronate, sodium PCA, various glycols, amino acids, glycolic acid, various plant sugars known as polysaccharides, honey, and the B vitamin panthenol. Humectants draw and bind this moisture to skin, then help evenly distribute it within skin’s water channels, known as aquaporins. This can give skin a plump, dewy, smooth look, which is why humectants are commonly used in moisturizers and serums. Along with attracting water from the ambient air, humectants can also pull it from skin’s lower layers. While that may sound like it would make dry skin worse, in reality humectants (and the ingredients paired with them) form a flexible film on skin that keeps the water that’s drawn from skin’s lower layers from evaporating. In essence, humectants are smart ingredients that attract moisture in the areas that skin needs it the most, and act accordingly to keep skin’s water levels balanced. Today’s best skin care products artfully combine humectants with emollients, replenishing fatty acids, peptides, and hydrating antioxidants to help skin get the most from them.

When the bead form of this ingredient is used, it can function as a gentle scrubbing agent for thoroughly cleansed skin. The hydrolyzed form can also improve oxidative stability of vulnerable antioxidants. At room temperature, hydrolyzed jojoba esters are a tacky, viscous gel. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has found that jojoba oil and its esters (including hydrolyzed jojoba esters) are safe as used in cosmetics."
Hydrolyzed Pumpkin Seedcake,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent",Used as a skin conditioning ingredient | Rich in phenols and flavonoids | High antioxidant activity | Byproduct of commercial pumpkin production,"Hydrolyzed pumpkin seedcake is a byproduct of pumpkin production in which oil is extracted from pumpkin seeds and what remains goes through the process of hydrolysis (the breakdown of a compound in reaction to water or enzymes). The specific pumpkin used in this process is the common orange pumpkin, Curcubita pepo . In cosmetics, hydrolyzed pumpkin seedcake is primarily used as a skin conditioning ingredient, though it also has antioxidant properties (thanks mainly to its phenolic and flavonoid content). In fact, research finds that the hydrolyzed version of pumpkin seedcake demonstrates higher antioxidant activity than the non-hydrolyzed version. The typical use level of hydrolyzed pumpkin seedcake is 1–3% when it’s part of a blend. It may appear on an ingredient list as Curcubita pepo (pumpkin) seed extract."
Hydrolyzed Rhodophycea (Red Algae) Extract,Best,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Plant Extracts, Humectant",,"Hydrolyzed rhodophycea is a type of red algae that, like most other types used in skin care products, helps improve skin’s hydration and ability to look healthy while also being a good source of antioxidants. Research has shown the antioxidants in many types of algae, including red algae, help offset the oxidative damage UVB light exposure triggers. Red algae is a rich source of carrageenan, which in cosmetics serves as a natural thickening and gelling ingredient. Interestingly, the structure of carrageenan closely resembles glycosaminoglycans, which are a key part of skin’s barrier. In this capacity, the carrageenan in red algae can help deliver other ingredients throughout skin’s uppermost layers. Along with carrageenan, red algae is a source of plant cholesterol, whose fatty acid compounds benefit skin."

Furthermore, studies indicate this ingredient has potential for evening skin tone and helps to inhibit certain processes in skin that cause dehydration. It’s also worth noting that hydrolyzed rice protein is rich in amino acids. Technically speaking, hydrolyzed rice protein is derived from rice grains that have undergone hydrolysis (chemically reacted) with an acid, enzyme or other methods. This ingredient can be “upcycled” as a byproduct of the rice production process. Hydrolyzed rice protein was reaffirmed as a safe cosmetic ingredient in the 2006 Cosmetic Ingredient Review report. The notated concentrations levels of hydrolyzed rice protein at that time were between 0.1–2.0% but more recent usage levels suggested by cosmetic suppliers may be higher (up to 5% based on what we found)."
Hydrolyzed Sodium Hyaluronate,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",Sodium hyaluronate that has gone through the process of hydrolysis | Lower molecular weight than sodium hyaluronate (whose molecular weight is lower than hyaluronic acid) | Sometimes referred to as “ultra-low weight hyaluronic acid” | White power in its raw form,"Hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate is sodium hyaluronate (the salt form of hyaluronic acid) that has gone through the process of hydrolysis. This process involves changing an ingredient from one form to another by the addition of water or enzymes. In this case, it results in a form of sodium hyaluronate with a lower molecular weight, meaning it can more readily penetrate skin. That lower molecular weight results in increased hydration in skin’s surface layers. Since sodium hyaluronate already has a lower molecular weight than hyaluronic acid, this form is sometimes referred to as “ultra-low molecular weight hyaluronic acid.” Even though that moniker sounds impressive, that doesn’t mean that hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate is better than non-hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate, simply that it works differently. It’s good to use multiple forms of hyaluronic acid (including hyaluronic acid) to make sure your skin care routine is as robust as possible. In its raw form, hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate is a white powder. Typical usage levels of hydrolyzed sodium hyaluronate range from 0.1–0.5% when combined with other types of hyaluronic acid. Used on its own, a 5% concentration (from a 1% solution) is advised."

The extract also contains several skin-friendly lipids that contribute to the strength of skin’s barrier and help maintain its resilience. This ingredient is typically obtained via fermentation using the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Along with improvements in hydration, barrier, and overall brightness of skin, it’s also been shown to surpass colloidal oatmeal in its ability to reduce itchy skin. Hydrolyzed yeast extract is most often added to a blend with other water-binding agents that bolster skin’s natural moisturizing factor and help preserve its barrier. Usage levels of such blends range from 1–3%. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics and in fact does not have restrictions on how much can be used in such products."
Hydroxyacetophenone,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Antioxidant, Humectant",Synthetic antioxidant and humectant | Helps boost preservative systems in many types of formulas | Noted for its soothing ability | Considered safe as used in cosmetics (final report pending),"Hydroxyacetophenone is a synthetic antioxidant and skin-conditioning ingredient. The specific antioxidant compound is actually known as p-hydroxyacetophenone, a phenolic antioxidant capable of neutralizing several different types of free radicals. Its secondary benefit is boosting the preservation system in cosmetics. This is advantageous because it allows cosmetic chemists to use a lower amount of preservatives (such as phenoxyethanol) without losing efficacy while at the same time reducing the risk of an allergic reaction. Even better, hydroxyacetophenone is stable across a wide pH range and types of emulsions, giving it great versatility. Usage levels of hydroxyacetophenone in cosmetics range from 0.00068%–5%, with a 0.5% concentration being recommended if the goal is to improve preservative efficacy while using a lower amount of the preservative(s). The lower amounts exhibit excellent soothing properties, so in essence this ingredient can also improve skin’s tolerance of standard cosmetic preservatives. A draft safety assessment for hydroxyacetophenone has been published, indicating that it’s not considered irritating or sensitizing when amounts typically used in cosmetics are applied to skin."

It has been proven to be effective for stopping moisture loss from skin’s uppermost layers. As a ceramide precursor (sometimes referred to as pseudoceramide), hydroxypalmitoyl sphinganine nudges skin’s uppermost layers to make more ceramides naturally. This is significant because ceramide-deficient skin is not able to retain moisture and keep its appearance firm and plump. In 2020, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that hydroxypalmitoyl sphinganine is safe in cosmetics in the practices of use and concentration described in their assessment. Their report looked at products containing between 0.0025-0.062% (high concentrations of this ingredient aren’t necessary for efficacy).

Hydroxypinacolone Retinoate,Best,"Anti-Acne, Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Acne, Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant, Retinoids","Ester of retinoic acid also known as Granactive Retinoid | More stable and gentle vitamin A derivative | Helps reduce and offset visible signs of aging, like fines lines and wrinkles | Is sensitive to light and air","Hydroxypinacolone retinoate (HPR) is an ester of retinoic acid and a relatively newer, more stable member of the ever-growing retinoid family, a group of powerhouse vitamin A derivatives that provide skin with potent benefits. Although hydroxypinacolone retinoate might seem like a foreign ingredient name, you’ve probably encountered this ingredient’s trade name, Granactive Retinoid Pro+. This type blends 10% HPR with 90% dimethyl isosorbide, a solvent. HPR is a multi-tasking ingredient that communicates with skin by binding to its retinoic acid receptors within skin’s surface layers. Although it connects directly with these receptors, it’s proven to be more gentle than retinoic acid (tretinoin) when applied topically, meaning more reactive and sensitive skin types might want to explore HPR as an alternative to pure retinol. Beyond its comparably gentle nature, research has proven that this retinoic acid ester provides skin both anti-aging and blemish-reducing benefits. Studies show that HPR assisted in reducing the occurrence of mild breakouts as well as the redness associated with them with little disturbance to the skin barrier when combined with retinol glycospheres and papain glycospheres. Those seeking to tackle fine lines and wrinkles as well an uneven tone can also seek out HPR as research has additionally proven this multi-tasking skin care ingredient reduced the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, as well as improved uneven tone. HPR can positively impact skin at percentages as low as .02%. However, its effectiveness drastically decreases when improperly packaged, such as when kept in jars exposed to light and air. Much like all other vitamin A derivatives and antioxidants, HPR must be kept in air-tight, opaque packaging to remain potent."
Hydroxypropyltrimonium Hyaluronate,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Film-Forming Agent, Humectant, Polymer",Next-gen derivative of moisture magnet hyaluronic acid | Strongly adheres to skin for instant + long-lasting hydration | Supports key proteins and lipids required for a strong barrier | Cationic charge resists water rinse-off | Texture-smoothing film-forming properties minus a tacky finish,"Hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate is a novel derivative of hyaluronic acid. The arrangement and weight of the hyaluronic acid molecule was altered to give it a strong cationic (positive) charge. Opposites attract, and since skin’s surface is negative, hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate clings to it, resisting rinse-off. As a result, this ingredient has long-lasting hydrating properties, even when used in products such as body wash and facial cleansers. This next-gen form of hyaluronic acid is clinically proven to boost skin’s hydration instantly and long-term. Additionally, its ability to spread and cling better to skin’s surface benefits its barrier, helping to prevent moisture loss and ensure skin stays plumped. Unlike standard hyaluronic acid, hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate helps influence key proteins and lipids responsible for a strong barrier. The cling factor this form of hyaluronic has gives it excellent film-forming properties, but its smaller size and ability to distribute evenly over skin’s surface avoids a sticky, tacky finish. Use levels of hydroxypropyltrimonium hyaluronate in cosmetics is typically 0.1%. It may be combined with other forms of hyaluronic acid for multi-level hydration and barrier support."

Idebenone,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant",,"Idebenone is a synthetic antioxidant similar to coenzyme Q10. The INCI name for idebenone is hydroxydecyl ubiquinone. Research for idebenone has not compared its effects to many of the hundreds of other potent antioxidants that commonly appear in other skin care products, nor did it compare the effects of idebenone with the effects of a combination of antioxidants. Perhaps a cocktail of antioxidants would far surpass idebenone - we don’t know. Other published studies compared the red grape antioxidant compound reseveratrol and L-ergothioneine to idebenone and found both superior to idebenone. To date, there are still no published, peer-reviewed studies that support idebenone’s alleged superiority. This does not mean idebenone is not a valid antioxidant for skin. Given what we know about how ubiquinone performs in the body, it is definitely not a throwaway ingredient. What is fairly certain, however, is that it is neither the best nor most potent antioxidant around. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel, in a final report on four ubiquinone ingredients published in 2022, concluded that these ingredients are safe for us in current cosmetic preparations."

It is a good source of antioxidants, including vitamins A, C, and K. In addition to these antioxidant properties, it also contains fatty acids, among them oleic, linoleic, linolenic, and stearic acids. These qualities make it an excellent skin and hair conditioning ingredient, not to mention the role linoleic and linolenic acids play in preserving skin’s barrier. One supplier describes broccoli seed oil as lightweight and non-greasy, making it preferred for a larger variety of skin types over more highly saturated oils such as coconut.

This is the type of lactic acid Paula’s Choice Skincare uses. In a pH-correct formula (ideally a pH between 3 and 4) and in concentrations between 5 and 12%, lactic acid exfoliates on the surface of skin. It does this by breaking down the material that holds dead skin together, allowing it to shed naturally as it once did. Lactic acid also has hydrating properties (as sodium lactate, it is part of skin’s natural moisturizing factor, or NMF). In addition to these benefits, lactic acid strengthens skin’s barrier by encouraging it to make more ceramides, a key component of healthy skin. It also strongly influences skin’s microbiome, helping to keep its first line of defense strong by positively interacting with a neuropeptide in skin’s surface known as Substance P, resulting in quick diffusion of signs skin is stressed. Like glycolic acid (another popular AHA), it helps brighten an uneven, dull skin tone."
Lactobacillius,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Prebiotic/Probiotic/Postbiotic",Typically made by fermentation of simple organisms | Helps condition and bind moisture to skin | Supports skin’s microbiome | Often used with skin-beneficial prebiotics,"Lactobacillus is a gram-positive, anerobic (doesn’t like oxygen) skin-friendly bacteria. It’s the starting point for literally hundreds of ingredients that offer numerous benefits for skin, including humectant, soothing, and supporting skin’s microbiome. The types of lactobacilli used in skin care are non-living but maintain many of the probiotic benefits of the living forms. One of the ways lactobacillus helps skin’s microbiome is by breaking down to lactic acid. This alpha hydroxy acid works with skin’s natural moisturizing factor (NMF) to maintain hydration. While non-living lysate or ferment forms of lactobacillus are used in skin care, foods such as yogurt, kimchi, and kefir use live forms, known as probiotics. Oral consumption of living probiotics and application of non-living probiotic ferments and lysates to skin have been shown to improve its moisture content, strengthen its barrier, and reduce signs of sensitivity. Lactobacillus and its many forms have various usage levels in cosmetics, typically between 0.1–2%, the latter being the recommended amount when lactobacillus ferment is used to augment the product’s preservative system. These strains have GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status when used in foods; as such, the much lower amounts used in cosmetics are also considered safe."

Studies also suggest that it plays a role in helping reinforce skin’s microbiome and thereby may reduce the severity of common skin conditions. The Personal Care Products Council classifies it as a skin-conditioning agent. Lactobacillus ferment lysate is a lab-created byproduct of the probiotic Lactobacillus. As it is converted into the lysate form, the outer membrane is broken down and it is no longer a living microorganism. This allows it to function more like a postbiotic, which can be safely and effectively incorporated into cosmetic formulations to replenish skin via microbiome support. Lactobacillus ferment lysate may also be used to ferment other skin care ingredients, such as plant extracts, to enhance their benefits (the fermentation process releases skin-friendly compounds and helps make them more bioavailable). In raw material form, Lactobacillus ferment lysate appears as a cloudy, yellowish-white liquid. It is important to note that further independent studies are needed to draw more definitive conclusions Lactobacillus ferment lysate’s benefits for skin, but at the time of this writing, what exists looks promising. Of note, emerging studies (funded by ingredient suppliers) show potential for Lactobacillus ferment lysate’s ability to prevent and treat visible signs of skin photoaging. Lactobacillus ferment lysate is also marketed by a few suppliers. Because the Lactobacillus genus is non-pathogenic, the INCI names do not include the species of Lactobacillus that is being used for the fermentation product. Some of the species used are bulgaricus , helveticus , plantarum , casei , rhamnosus and acidophillus . Therefore, the different Lactobacillus ferment lysates may have very different effects on the skin."

It is chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between lactobionic acid and AHAs is that lactobionic acid has a larger molecular structure, which limits its ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for stinging. Polyhydroxy acids can also function as antioxidants and may promote some improvement in skin’s surface strength. Their antioxidant ability is due to being able to bind with (chelate) heavy metals that would otherwise damage skin. Lactic acid also has this benefit. Typical usage levels of lactobionic acid in skin care range from 0.1–5%, with amounts above 3% considered necessary if the goal is exfoliation. Interestingly, research has shown no difference in skin response when a 10% and 30% concentration of lactobionic acid were compared as facial peels. Low levels have been shown to help protect skin’s supportive elements from damage triggered by destructive enzymes. This benefit is tied to lactobionic acid’s ability to improve a sallow skin tone which can be a common visible trait on sun-damaged skin. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics, and is an intriguing ingredient to consider if you have extra-sensitive, redness-prone skin."

Applied topically, it helps soothe skin and, like all forms of seaweed, Laminaria ochroleuca extract has some amount of moisture-binding properties. Researchers note that this ingredient is particularly useful for those prone to sensitive skin. It can play a role in reinforcing skin’s barrier and thus, can be used to help ease the negative effects environmental aggressors have on skin. It is believed that Laminaria ochroleuca extract’s lipid content is partially responsible for this improvement. It’s also been shown to improve the content of skin’s surface lipids, which in turn builds a stronger barrier. This extract offers antioxidant properties, which contribute to anti-aging benefits for skin. Primary antioxidants in this type of algae include zeaxanthin, β-carotene, chlorophyll, and several epicatechin compounds whish also play a role in reducing signs of sensitivity. Laminaria ochroleuca extract was assessed for safety by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel in 2019.

It’s a medium chain triglyceride (MCT) also naturally present in skin’s oil. This fatty acid plays an important role in reinforcing skin’s innate defenses by strengthening its microbiome. Lauric acid has multiple uses in cosmetics, including as an emulsifier and texture-enhancing ingredient. Its natural bay leaf-like scent can be used in high amounts to add fragrance to products, but it’s more often used as a base for cleansing agents, and, increasingly, for its skin-soothing actions. Some studies have shown it can also have antimicrobial activity. Research continues to investigate lauric acid’s benefits as an adjunct to anti-acne treatments. As a raw material, lauric acid can appear as a colorless solid or as a slightly glossy white or yellow crystalline solid or powder. It may be animal- or plant-derived; Paula’s Choice uses the latter.

Lecithin is naturally present in many living organisms, but in cosmetic formulas it’s almost always derived from plants such as soy, sunflower or rapeseed. Lecithin’s beneficial components include phospholipids (which convey skin-restoring benefits), fatty acids and triglycerides that can help replenish skin. Lecithin can also be used to encapsulate a wide range of active ingredients allowing for a better dermal delivery system. Lecithin’s appearance as a raw material varies based on the origin and extraction process, but in cosmetic use it typically presents as a viscous liquid or as powder. In a safety assessment conducted in 2020, the highest concentration of lecithin that was reported was 50% in a leave-on foot product, which was deemed safe. Facial skin care products typically safely contain much lower concentrations than that, usually between 0.5-2%."

Licorice extract is a general term; in many cases cosmetics companies will use specific parts of the plant in their formulations, such as licorice root or seed extract, accompanied by the plant’s complete Latin name. Licorice is valuable in skin care products for numerous reasons. First and foremost, as a plant extract, it has antioxidant properties that enable it to fight off one of the leading causes of aging, oxidative stress. Of particular interest is one of licorice’s main compounds, glycyrrhetinic acid. In addition to its function as an antioxidant, there are numerous studies showing it has potent anti-inflammatory properties as well, making it a welcome addition to products designed to treat compromised or reddened skin. Even more impressive, research demonstrates that an indirect benefit of this trait is the minimization of dark patches and uneven tone."

Limnanthes Alba (Meadowfoam) Seed Oil,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Plant Extracts",,"Limnanthes alba (meadowfoam) seed oil is a non-fragrant, edible plant oil originally developed as an agricultural crop in the 1950s. It functions as an emollient and softening agent in skin care and hair care products. This plant oil is exceedingly stable because it is primarily composed of long chain fatty acids, the type most resistant to rancidity when exposed to oxygen. Among plant oils, meadowfoam has the highest concentration (95%) of these highly stable fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to products that would otherwise be prone to spoiling quickly. Meadowfoam seed oil contains two compounds known as glucosinolate derivatives, 3-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate (MBITC) and 3-methoxyphenyl acetonitrile. Research has shown these compounds can inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure (but just to be clear, these ingredients do not replace the need for broad spectrum sunscreen). The glucosinolate derivatives are not direct antioxidants (indeed, meadowfoam seed oil isn’t a good source of antioxidants), but they can positively influence skin’s own antioxidant defenses, which is a nice benefit. Meadowfoam seed oil can also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into soil and across animal skin; however, to date the same benefit hasn’t been shown to occur on human skin. On the upside, the long-chain fatty acids in this plant oil have chemical similarity to some of the fatty acids found in skin’s own oil, so in theory it’s certainly possible meadowfoam oil would help deliver other oil-based (lipophilic) ingredients to skin."

In addition, research shows it to be effective as a skin restorative, an antioxidant, and as a skin-soothing agent. There are even some studies demonstrating that it could have some discolouration fading properties due to its ability to inhibit excess melanin production. Since linoleic acid is a component of many edible oils, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has ruled it safe as a direct and indirect food additive.

It is considered one of two essential fatty acids for humans, meaning they must be ingested because the body cannot produce them naturally. The other is linoleic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid. Deficiencies of linolenic acid in the body are believed to play a role in disorders such as eczema; supplementation with this omega-3 fatty acid has been shown to visibly improve this condition. In cosmetics, linolenic acid functions as a skin conditioning agent and skin restorative ingredient.

Studies find that madecassoside has potent antioxidant properties. It also has strong anti-inflammatory properties, making it a valuable addition to formulas designed to soothe compromised skin or help thwart the visible effect of external sensitizers. Even more encouraging, research shows that madecassoside can tackle factors that lead to the development of dark spots. In fact, when combined with rosmarinic acid (a compound found in many culinary herbs), madecassoside helps prevent skin aging caused by ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation exposure. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review has ruled madecassoside safe in its current use in cosmetics.

Magnesium Ascorbyl Phosphate,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Antioxidant, Humectant","Water-soluble yet oil-loving stabilized form of vitamin C | Delivers many of the same benefits as vitamin C | Promotes hydration deeper in skin, but not as potent an antioxidant as pure vitamin C | Isn’t beholden to a low pH for efficacy and is generally well tolerated | Soothing properties may play a role in reducing blemishes","Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate (MAP, for short) is a water-soluble form of vitamin C made by combining ascorbic acid (pure vitamin C) with a magnesium salt to improve its stability in water-based formulas. It is considered stable in the presence of light and air but is not impervious to diminished efficacy when exposure to both elements is persistent. Unlike other water-soluble forms of vitamin C, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate is also lipophilic, or oil-loving, which improves penetration into skin (although how well this form converts to ascorbic acid within skin is up for debate). Because of its oil-loving nature and its ability to promote hydration deeper in skin when compared to ascorbic acid (which instead showed greater antioxidant ability), MAP is considered one of the most hydrating forms of vitamin C. Like most forms of vitamin C, magnesium ascorbyl phosphate has been shown to improve the look of an uneven skin tone when used in concentrations between 2-5%. Concentrations between 5-10% are known to have more pronounced benefits for discolorations, including post-breakout marks, as well as improving skin’s firm look and feel. Amounts below 2% all the way down to 0.1% still deliver antioxidant benefits. Magnesium ascorbyl phosphate does not require the same low pH ascorbic acid does in order to be effective. It works best at pH levels between 5-6. Going above pH 6 can cause this ingredient to discolor. This form of vitamin C may play a special role in reducing the likelihood of blemishes since its soothing action helps quell an of oil-based saccharide that can irritate skin. However, research on this matter was not comparative, meaning we don’t know how a range of other forms of vitamin C would’ve fared. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics."

Magnesium PCA therefore plays an influential role in what’s known as skin’s natural moisturizing factor. As an electrolyte mineral, magnesium plays a role in enhancing skin hydration and barrier repair. It also influences how skin cells move through skin’s surface layers, how they shed, and how skin responds to external stimuli. Interestingly, pure magnesium and some forms such as magnesium chloride have a difficult time penetrating skin. Linking magnesium with PCA helps to overcome this issue, allowing skin to benefit.

It also occurs naturally in the human body as a by-product from turning carbohydrates into energy. Although it’s technically a beta hydroxy acid ingredient, it is primarily classified as an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA) because its hydroxyl group in the alpha position is believed to be dominant to the beta hydroxyl group. Also, it is not known to be oil-soluble like traditional beta hydroxy acid salicylic acid. Malic acid is used in cosmetics to adjust a product’s pH and, in an acidic pH range ideally between 3 and 4, as a mild exfoliant that can be used in lower concentrations (typically between 1–2%) to boost the efficacy of other AHA exfoliants such as glycolic and lactic acids.

Mandelic Acid,Best,"Smooths Bumpy Skin, Evens Skin Tone","Smooths Bumpy Skin, Evens Skin Tone, Exfoliant",The gentlest alpha hydroxy acid | Excellent choice for sensitive skin | Helps firm and fade post-breakout marks,"What is mandelic acid? Mandelic acid is a type of alpha hydroxy acid (AHA). Although in the correct pH range of 3–4 it’s an effective exfoliant, glycolic acid is considered more effective due to its smaller size. As the smallest AHA, mandelic acid is twice as large as glycolic so penetrates more slowly and evenly into skin. These traits make mandelic acid more tolerable for those with sensitive skin or skin cannot tolerate glycolic acid. It’s even suitable for skin prone to rosacea. Unlike glycolic acid, mandelic acid is light-sensitive and must be packaged in an opaque container to remain effective. Because of this, mandelic acid is less likely to make skin more sensitive to sunlight, an issue with glycolic acid that means daily sunscreen use becomes even more important. This acid may be synthetic or derived from almonds (Paula’s Choice uses the synthetic kind). Like other AHAs, mandelic acid is most effective in leave-on products when used in concentrations of 5% or greater. Is mandelic acid an AHA option that is effective for improving uneven skin tone? Mandelic acid seems to have a slight edge over other AHAs when it comes to fading hyperpigmentation, particularly post-breakout marks, melasma, and dark spots from sun exposure, although exactly why this is unknown. It is well tolerated by all skin tones. Chemically, mandelic acid is oil-loving and water-loving (hydrophilic), allowing it to offer multi-level benefits which include helping skin look and feel firmer and smoother. Mandelic acid can also be combined with BHA or other AHA ingredients. A couple studies have shown that mandelic acid and salicylic acid worked well together in a higher-strength peel for use on darker skin tones struggling with discolorations, including post-acne marks. Other research using mandelic acid on its own at a 45% strength have shown impressive efficacy and gentleness compared to similar-strength AHA peels, and such peels are considered safe for sensitive skin. Last, research has shown peel-strength amounts (30% and up) of mandelic acid can increase sebum (oil) production, which isn’t great for oily skin but would be a benefit for dry skin. For this reason, people struggling with discolorations and dry skin may derive dual benefits from such peels."

Manuka Honey,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Primarily produced in New Zealand | Has more methylglyoxal that other honey | Methylglyoxal aids in skin healing | Also has soothing properties,"Manuka honey is a type of honey found in many skin care products. It’s primarily produced in New Zealand from bees that pollinate the country’s native Manuka shrub, Latin name Leptospermum scoparium . Since Manuka honey is only made from this specific plant, it’s categorized as a monofloral honey. Wild honey is considered multifloral because it’s made from nectar that bees consume from numerous flowering plants. Both types of honey are used in skin care, but when manuka is used, you’ll see its Latin name, Leptospermum scoparium on the label. Chemically, manuka honey is like “regular” clover honey except it’s said to contain more of a chemical called methylglyoxal and does not contain or has low amounts of a compound known as defensin-1. The higher amount of methylglyoxal is believed to give manuka honey an advantage when it comes to healing wounds since it is better at preventing harmful biofilms on skin’s surface. These surface films contain substances that reduce skin’s ability to recover from damage. Some comparative research shows that manuka honey doesn’t necessarily have an edge over other varieties for general skin-calming properties; however, as with any natural ingredient, the quality and how it’s sourced can impact performance in skin care formulas and on skin itself."

These two “messenger” peptides (sometimes referred to as matrikines) work synergistically to send repair signals via skin’s surface that help mitigate visible skin damage and strengthen skin’s supportive elements. Studies have shown ongoing use can lead to a reduction in wrinkle depth. Glycerin, water, butylene glycol, carbomer and polysorbate 20 make up the rest of the Matrixyl™ 3000 blend. Along with smoothing the appearance of wrinkles, Matrixyl™ 3000 has been shown to calm visible signs of sensitization. The suggested usage concentration of Matrixyl™ 3000 is 3%, although higher or lower amounts may be used depending on the formulary goals. The actual peptide concentration of this blend is much lower than 3% (peptides can work in surprisingly low amounts). Both peptides in Matrixyl™ 3000 have undergone independent safety/toxicology reviews and were deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel."

This plant oil not only delivers skin-softening properties, but it also offers deeper rooted benefits that can contribute anti-aging benefits. Of note, Mauritia flexuosa fruit oil, is a rich source of antioxidants, including carotenoids, vitamin E and vitamin C. These help protect the skin from negative effects of environmental stressors and help delay premature signs of aging like discolorations and fine lines. Mauritia flexuosa fruit oil also supplies skin with beneficial fatty acids and phytosterols that are known for their moisturizing and soothing effects. Overall, Mauritia flexuosa fruit oil has a number of benefits for skin health and hence is a welcome addition to your skin care routine. Unlike essential oils, it does not contain volatile fragrance compounds that irritate skin, although it does have a natural earthy/nutty aroma. Mauritia flexuosa fruit oil can be found in sunscreens, lotions, bath oils and other personal care products. It is best stored in air-tight, opaque packaging to keep its antioxidant content stable and effective. The raw material is typically preserved with vitamin E (tocopherol) to enhance stability. At the time of this writing, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has not conducted a formal assessment of Mauritia flexuosa fruit oil but there are no known concerns with its safety. Typical usage level is 1%, but there are no contraindications for using amounts up to 100% if desired. Fun fact: Mauritia flexuosa fruit has a thick, oily pulp, with an orange hue attributed to its lipids and carotenoids (β-carotene)."
Meadowfoam Seed Oil,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Emollient, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Plant Extracts",Highly stable due to its composition of long-chain fatty acids | Functions as an emollient and softening agent | More resistant to rancidity than other natural oils | Contains compounds that can help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure,"Meadowfoam seed oil is a non-fragrant, edible plant oil originally developed as an agricultural crop in the 1950s. It functions as an emollient and softening agent in skin care and hair care products. This plant oil is exceedingly stable because it is primarily composed of long chain fatty acids, the type most resistant to rancidity when exposed to oxygen. Among plant oils, meadowfoam has the highest concentration (95%) of these highly stable fatty acids, making it a valuable addition to products that would otherwise be prone to spoiling quickly. Meadowfoam seed oil contains two compounds known as glucosinolate derivatives, 3-methoxybenzyl isothiocyanate (MBITC) and 3-methoxyphenyl acetonitrile. Research has shown these compounds can inhibit collagen-degrading enzymes in skin and help offset the negative impact of UVB light exposure (but just to be clear, these ingredients do not replace the need for broad spectrum sunscreen). The glucosinolate derivatives are not direct antioxidants (indeed, meadowfoam seed oil isn’t a good source of antioxidants), but they can positively influence skin’s own antioxidant defenses, which is a nice benefit. Meadowfoam seed oil can also enhance the penetration of other ingredients into soil and across animal skin; however, to date the same benefit hasn’t been shown to occur on human skin. On the upside, the long-chain fatty acids in this plant oil have chemical similarity to some of the fatty acids found in skin’s own oil, so in theory it’s certainly possible meadowfoam oil would help deliver other oil-based (lipophilic) ingredients to skin."

In this regard, it can also be considered an anti-aging ingredient as it helps prevent accelerated signs of aging triggered by sun exposure. Methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol is unique in that researchers describe its mechanism of action as a hybrid of a chemical + physical sun protection. A portion of the molecule is microfine pigments that help reflect and scatter UV light before it can harm skin, and another portion is an organic UV light absorber, converting UV light into harmless heat energy that dissipates from skin’s surface. Another unique property is that it is neither water nor oil soluble. It is noted in research for its ability to help improve the stability of other sunscreen ingredients. The molecular size of this ingredient keeps it on skin’s surface, meaning it’s less likely to trigger a sensitized response for people whose skin tends to respond unfavorably to synthetic UV filters. While methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol is available for sunscreen use in many countries worldwide (including those in the European Union and Asia, as well in Australia and Mexico), it is not currently FDA-approved as an active sunscreen agent in the United States. This does not mean this ingredient is unsafe, but rather that it is still under review in this region. In other capacities, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol can be used as a supporting ingredient to protect cosmetic formulations from deterioration by absorbing, reflecting, or scattering UV light. In 2015, the European Commission for Health & Consumer Protection submitted their opinion on the safety of methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol. Their report deemed it does not pose a risk to the health of the consumer at a maximum concentration of 10%. As a raw material, methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol comes as yellowish powder or white viscous liquid (nano form). Depending on how it is incorporated into the formula, this ingredient can contribute a white cast, although cosmetic chemists can take measures to mitigate this. This ingredient also goes by Tinosorb M and Bisoctrizole."

Morus Alba (White Mulberry) Root Extract,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",,"Morus alba (white mulberry) root extract has antioxidant properties, but its main benefit for skin has to do with calming signs of irritation along with its potential to fade the look of discolorations and uneven skin tone. White mulberry root contains compounds known as flavonoids, some of which have been shown to interrupt the process that keeps discolorations looking more apparent. Interestingly, some research has shown that mulberry twigs work in a different manner to improve uneven skin color, as the twig contains a different mix of beneficial ingredients than the root. The same is true for the leaves of this plant, which are a rich source of the skin tone-improving antioxidant oxyresveratrol (although this compound is also present in the root, it’s more concentrated in the leaf). Overall, topical application of this plant extract helps calm stressed skin, which in turn reduces signs of environmental damage and fosters a brighter, more radiant skin tone."

Beneficial compounds commonly found in mushroom extracts cultivated all over the world can improve numerous concerns such as skin discoloration, dryness, wrinkles and a compromised barrier. Of note, key antioxidants such as glutathione and ergothioneine, found in many mushroom extracts, improve skin’s response to pollutants and external threats to its immune system. This makes skin stronger and healthier, helping to keep the body’s first line of defense in top shape. There’s no single best mushroom extract to seek out—rather, there are several species that benefit skin. Keep in mind mushroom extracts may be listed by their Latin name or common name. For example, Ganoderma lucidum is a skin-friendly mushroom extract that is more widely known by its common name, Reishi. The same goes for Northern Truffle (_Albatrellus confluens_) and Snow Mushroom (_Tremella fuciformis_)—both of which are incredibly soothing for skin, among their other benefits. Mushrooms extracts are processed in a way that eliminates the water component (whole mushrooms that you’d buy in the grocery store generally contain over 90% water, which is why they shrink when cooked). In extract form, only a small amount is needed to obtain benefit. Most of the mushroom extracts used in skin care are also edible. As such, they’re considered safe for use on skin, and allergic reactions to mushrooms when eaten are considered uncommon."

Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing, Antioxidant, Humectant",Coenzyme responsible for supplying energy to every cell in the body | Not easily bioavailable when applied to skin | Niacinamide is a precursor to NAD+ | Unknown if topical niacinamide directly converts to NAD+,"Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide—NAD+ for short—is a coenzyme found throughout the body. More than 300 enzymes in the body rely on it to do their jobs. In short, NAD is a critical ingredient for human health. Systemically, NAD+ triggers a redox reaction (the process of gaining or losing electrons) that provides energy for every cell in the body. It plays a role in maintenance and repair plus serves as a cofactor for several enzymes the body needs to maintain itself. Research has revealed that an age-related decrease in NAD+ levels plus the enzyme that helps recycle it have a direct link or strong correlation to metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders as well as being drivers of cellular senescence (when cells become unable to divide but then go on to misbehave) and immune system impairment. Essentially, what happens with this decline is that enzymes which rely on NAD+ for homeostasis (balance) degrade, which alters how they behave. Two precursors of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide—nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) are currently the subjects of intense research on their health-promoting and longevity benefits when taken as supplements. Both play proven roles in increasing the body’s levels of NAD+, although much still needs to be discovered about their long-term benefits and whether such supplements are necessary for a broad aging population. All the above is about the role of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in the body, but what about when this ingredient is applied to skin? Although nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a registered cosmetic ingredient, it’s of little use in skin care since it cannot penetrate skin’s moisture barrier or impact the pore lining. We’re aware of one supplier who encapsulated this ingredient, but even then it doesn’t remain intact—skin cells must rebuild it to use it. Still, it’s proven that the decline of NAD+ in the body impacts the health and appearance of skin. For example, certain substances that rely on the energy NAD+ provides for repair is one reason aging skin becomes more vulnerable to environmental stressors. Without this maintenance-related repair, environmental damage accumulates faster, taking a visible toll on skin. This includes the attack and breakdown of skin’s healthy collagen and elastin! Interestingly, boosting levels of the NAD+ recycling enzyme in skin has been shown to over-express key enzymes responsible for driving the inflammation behind certain skin disorders. This is one more reason to speak to your doctor if you’re considering any type of NAD+ supplement. What’s the difference between nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and niacinamide? Niacinamide is a derivative of the B vitamin niacin. It can be converted to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in the body; however, NAD+ precursors such as nicotinamide riboside are better at this. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is a coenzyme, and niacinamide is a vitamin. Does niacinamide break down to NAD+ on or within skin? It’s currently unknown if this happens from topical use of products that contain niacinamide. However, it’s thought that applying niacinamide to skin may have a stimulating effect on surface cells capable of generating NAD+ or that niacinamide may boost the ribose enzymes required for NAD+ production. As such, a theoretical indirect relationship exists but direct cause-and-effect evidence is lacking. This doesn’t negate the numerous benefits topical use of niacinamide has for skin, including barrier repair, soothing, pore size reduction, antioxidant-boosting and improving uneven skin tone."

In skin care, it stands out for being a powerful antioxidant that can help defend skin against daily environmental stressors, including reducing the visible toll UV exposure has on skin. Suppliers of this ingredient also tout its ability to prevent the oxidation of oil, thereby making the assumption that it can be helpful to those prone to blackheads. (Blackheads are triggered by the reaction of oil + air). More independent research is needed in this regard, but in theory, it looks promising. Nordihydroguaiaretic acid is derived from the twigs and leaves of the desert shrub Larrea tridentata (Creosote bush), native to Mexico and the United States. It can also be created synthetically, which case it has an off-white powder appearance and is recommend in usage levels ranging from 0.001-0.01%."

Beta-glucan can also be derived from various other natural sources such as yeast, fungi, and seaweed. It is commonly included in skin care products as a soothing agent and is considered an excellent ingredient for minimizing redness and other signs of sensitive skin. Beta-glucan also offers antioxidant properties and has been shown to help visibly minimize signs of aging/sun damage (including reducing the look of wrinkle depth and rough, uneven tone). Certain sources of beta-glucan also offer film-forming moisturizing properties. In early research, it was hypothesized that beta-glucan’s high molecular weight would inhibit it from penetrating skin, thereby limiting its benefits to just the surface, but in more recent studies, beta-glucan has been proven to permeate skin by passing between cells. In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed beta-glucan as safe in cosmetic formulations in the present practices of use at a 1% max concentration."

It is also called Avena sativa bran extract. Rather than being discarded as waste, oat bran is a potent source of beneficial bioactive compounds that can be both consumed for its fiber content (among other benefits) and used topically. Researchers have found that oat bran extract contains phenolic compounds and flavonoids with rich antioxidant properties for anti-aging benefits. Oat bran extract is also a source of beta-glucan, which can help visibly minimize the appearance of wrinkle depth and other signs of aging. In addition, beta-glucan is well-known for its soothing properties, aiding in visibly reducing redness and irritation. All of this makes oat bran extract suitable for sensitive, eczema-prone skin.

Octinoxate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",Globally approved UV filter used for 50+ years | Provides excellent UVB protection | Filters a portion of UVA rays | Backed by numerous studies confirming its safety as used in sunscreens | Its cinnamic acid component can be allergenic for some | Also known as octyl methoxycinnamate and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate,"Also known as octyl methoxycinnamate and ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, octinoxate is the oldest and most common sunscreen active used in sunscreens around the world. Technically considered broad spectrum on its own, octinoxate remains most effective within the UVB range, since its UVA-protecting abilities peak at 360 nanometers (the UVA light spectrum goes from 320–400 nanometers). Interestingly, research has also shown that peak UV absorption of octinoxate is 310 nanometers, just shy of where the UVA spectrum begins. But for certain, octinoxate is a reliable UVB filter. Octinoxate has a solid record of safety backed by decades of research and mounds of studies. No studies have demonstrated that octinoxate, as used in SPF products, is harmful to people. In the studies where such claims are made, the conditions simply do not apply to how octinoxate is used in sunscreens. This sunscreen ingredient’s cinnamic acid component can be allergenic for some people; however, this is an individual response and simply means your skin cannot tolerate this ingredient. Octinoxate is not considered irritating or photosensitizing to broad populations. The risk of an allergic response can be minimized by formulating octinoxate in the oil phase (not the water phase) of a sunscreen. This along with other formulary steps such as encapsulation and special emulsification approaches also stabilize octinoxate. When such steps are not taken, upwards of 60% of octinoxate’s protective ability in a sunscreen is lost when exposed to UV light. But since this issue is well known among sunscreen chemists, it’s not a concern for today’s sunscreens with octinoxate. Octinoxate is sometimes accused of being a hormone disruptor. This effect has primarily been demonstrated via oral intake of large amounts of this ingredient or examining its effect on isolated cells. In cases where a hormonal change was measured via topical application, the difference was one million-fold less than what was measured from normal hormonal activity in the body. Studies involving people have shown that octinoxate does not have a biologically significant effect on hormones. There isn’t any research backing the claim that octinoxate has any link to health risks when used in sunscreen formulas. In fact, the European Union’s (EU) permitted usage level for octinoxate in sunscreens is higher than the maximum amount permitted in the United States (7.5% in the United States, 10% in the EU). China, Australia, Brazil, Argentina, India and Thailand are among the other countries permitting octinoxate levels up to 10%. Octinoxate is often accused of being a threat to coral reefs and has been banned from use in sunscreen in some parts of the world; however, numerous data gaps exist on this issue. Such gaps include the lack of information on many other UV filters whose effects on coral reefs have yet to be studied. More important, research is clear that several other factors, from changing climate to coastal development and invasive species have a much stronger link to coral reef damage and demise than sunscreen use by people. This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. As referenced above, the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing."
Octisalate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",Works primarily in the UVB range | Has excellent stability | Improves the stability of other UV filters | Globally approved in amounts from 5–10% | Helps neutralize the sun-induced formation of oxygen radicals,"Octisalate is a synthetic sunscreen ingredient that works primarily in the range of UVB light while offering a small amount of UVA protection. It is also known as octyl salicylate and ethylhexyl salicylate. This globally approved sunscreen ingredient is used in concentrations up to 10%, with 5% being a typical amount when combined with other UV filters. Such combinations are necessary since octisalate, like homosalate, is not a very efficient UVB absorber and must be used with more efficient UVB absorbers (i.e. octocrylene and octinoxate) to achieve high SPF. In addition, octisalate doesn’t provide sufficient UVA protection on its own. Octisalate has been deemed safe as used as used in cosmetics and is not considered an eye or skin irritant. Research has shown this UV filter can neutralize singlet oxygen, a type of skin-damaging free radical generated by exposure to UVB light. This sunscreen active is one of several currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use.

Octocrylene,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",Effective stabilizer for UVA filter avobenzone as well as an approved UVB absorber | Primarily provides UVB protection but kicks in some UVA screening | Globally approved up to a 10% concentration (Canada permits 12%) | Emollient texture helps moisturize skin | Highly stable in the presence of UV light,"Octocrylene is a globally approved sunscreen agent that primarily protects skin from the UVB range of sunlight while providing a small amount of UVA protection. It also helps stabilize the UVA sunscreen ingredient avobenzone. Therefore, the two are often found in the same sunscreen formulas. This UV filter is highly stable in the presence of sunlight and can make it easier for chemists to incorporate other UV filters to achieve higher SPF ratings without worry that the filters will crystallize, which hinders their effectiveness. Octocrylene has been extensively reviewed and is considered safe as used in cosmetics and sunscreens. It does not have endocrine-disrupting properties and is considered a “rare sensitizer”, as are many other synthetic UV filters. Note: Octocrylene has a history of causing an allergic reaction on skin of people who are also applying the topical anti-inflammatory drug ketoprofen. If you use this medication, ask your health care provider about using sunscreens that contain octocrylene.

For centuries it has been used in traditional medicine by some Native American tribes for various benefits, including increased energy and soothing damaged skin. Research demonstrates that Oenothera biennis oil has high value when it comes to its inclusion in skin care products. Because it is a plant extract, it has antioxidant benefits, primarily through its high vitamin E content. Evening primrose oil is also an excellent moisturizer thanks to its concentration of the essential fatty acids linoleic and linolenic acids. In fact, evening primrose oil boasts an impressive 74% concentration of linolenic acid! Use of Oenothera biennis oil in tests has shown an increase in barrier function and moisture, even in people with skin conditions such as eczema. In short, this non-fragrant plant oil is an excellent addition to any skin care product. Typical use levels of evening primrose oil in cosmetics range from 0.1–20%.

Though the oil extracted from olive fruit is well known for its skin care uses (particularly in helping protect skin’s moisture barrier), emerging research shows that there are multiple benefits to topical application of olive leaf extract. Studies show olive leaf extract has a potent ability to fight free-radical damage, and phenolic compounds, including catechin and rutin. These qualities make it an excellent antioxidant to use in anti-aging skin care products. There is even some research demonstrating olive leaf extract may have some photoprotective ability and can help reduce UVA-induced skin damage, though more studies need to be done to see just how effective it is in this capacity. Usage of Olea europaea leaf extract is also considered environmentally friendly, since it’s a byproduct of the olive oil industry.

Oleic Acid,Best,,"Cleansing Agent, Texture Enhancer",Omega-9 fatty acid found in many plants | Primary fatty acid found in olive oil | Cleansing agent + texture enhancer | Has improved skin calming abilities when combined with other lipids,"Oleic acid is a natural, monounsaturated omega-9 fatty acid found in many plants, including grape seed, olives, and sea buckthorn. It’s the primary fatty acid in olive oil and believed to play a role in this oil’s cholesterol-lowering benefits when consumed orally. Interestingly, research has shown that topical application of oleic acid on its own or as olive oil can disrupt skin’s barrier; however, this effect was not observed when oleic acid was blended with other fatty acids and skin-beneficial ingredients. On the upside, this kind of barrier disruption can enhance penetration of other ingredients naturally present in plant oils or in the product, so it’s not necessarily all bad (and, as we mentioned, not bad at all unless you’re applying pure oleic acid or straight olive oil to skin). In another interesting twist, combining oleic acid with other lipids (fats) boosts its skin-calming ability, thus making oleic acid useful for reducing signs of dryness and sensitivity when used in this capacity. In cosmetics, oleic acid is used as a cleansing agent and texture enhancer. It’s among the more stable unsaturated fatty acids and has a unique ability to preserve the effectiveness of more delicate ingredients such as antioxidants by helping to protect them from light and air degradation. In hair care formulations, the use of oleic acid can help impart a healthy shine to hair. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled oleic acid safe as used in cosmetics, where typical usage ranges from 1–10%. Lastly, oleic acid is also naturally occurring in cosmetic ingredients stearic and palmitic acids."

As this category of peptides has expanded over time, specific INCI names have been introduced for differentiation. However, the umbrella term “oligopeptide-1” may still be used. While oligopeptide-1 is generally categorized as a “skin-conditioning agent,” specific oligopeptide-1 derivatives offer more targeted anti-aging benefits. One such standout is Nicotiana benthamiana hexapeptide-40 sh-oligopeptide-1, which is a plant-derived pro-collagen peptide that specializes in improving skin’s elasticity and reducing the look of wrinkles. Documented benefits of other oligopeptides are quite varied and include visible fading of dark spots, skin-soothing action, and potential to manage breakout-prone skin. Use levels of oligopeptide-1 in skin care are 1–2% when it is supplied in a water-based blend (which means the actual concentration of the peptide is much lower since these ingredients typically work in the parts per million level). For more detailed information on specific oligopeptide derivatives, please refer to the related ingredient listings."

Palmitoyl Hexapeptide-12,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",A synthetic peptide that matches a sequence of amino acids found in skin | Signals skin to look younger by boosting its firm feeling | Creates a supple surface by strengthening skin’s barrier | Requires a surprisingly low amount for efficacy,"Palmitoyl hexapeptide-12 is a lab-made peptide that blends the fatty acid palmitic acid with several amino acids, including glycine, histidine, and lysine. Combining this specifically engineered peptide with palmitic acid enhances its penetration into skin as well as the peptide’s stability. In the early days of peptides in skin care it went by the catchall term palmitoyl oligopeptide. The amino acid sequence of this peptide mimics that of peptides naturally occurring in skin, meaning skin recognizes and can readily utilize it. It works on and within skin’s uppermost layers by influencing key supportive elements in skin that result in a firmer surface and minimized appearance of wrinkles. It also strengthens skin’s barrier by improving moisture retention, leaving skin feeling supple instead of rough. As a signal peptide, it can “tell” skin to look younger. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics, where its calculated efficacy is in the parts per million range. This translates to very low percentages used in skin care, as low as 0.0000001%; however, research is clear that small amounts of this peptide can produce impressive results. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel found palmitoyl hexapeptide-12 is safe as used in skin care products. Palmitoyl hexapeptide-12 is most often used on its own rather than being part of a blend with other peptides, although such blends are available."
Palmitoyl Oligopeptide,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",,"Synthetic blend of the fatty acid palmitic acid with several amino acids. Also known as pal-KTTKS. Theoretically, many peptides have skin-restoring ability. Palmitoyl oligopeptide was the former catchall name for a handful of peptides, including palmitoyl hexapeptide-12. As more peptides were synthesized for use in skincare, specific names were developed to avoid confusion."
Palmitoyl Pentapeptide-4,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",,"Trade name Matrixyl, a fatty acid mixed with amino acids. Manufactured by the French lab Sederma, it is used primarily as an ingredient in cosmetics making anti-wrinkle claims. Studies both from Sederma and from independent researchers have shown palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 can have an impact on the visual signs of aging, including fine lines and wrinkles."
Palmitoyl Proline,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",,"Palmitoyl proline combines fatty acid palmitic acid with the amino acid proline. It may be synthetic, animal-derived, or plant-derived (Paula's Choice uses the latter).   On skin, palmitoyl proline acts as a surface treatment by contributing a soft feeling. It also helps cosmetic pigments stay blended in a formula.   The proline component can help shore up skin's natural supportive elements while the palmitic acid portion prevents moisture loss."
Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-7,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Composed of four amino acids + palmitic acid | Can fight factors in skin that cause irritation | Ongoing use helps restore a firmer feel,"Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is a synthetic peptide composed of the amino acids glutamine, glycine, arginine, and proline. It works as a skin-restoring ingredient and is noted for its soothing ability since it can interrupt factors within skin that lead to signs of irritation (including from exposure to UVB light) and loss of firmness. By working in this manner, skin can regain a firm feeling and engage in repair so that wrinkles will be visibly reduced. Along with the four amino acids, this peptide also contains the fatty acid palmitic acid to enhance stability and penetration into the skin. Typical usage level is in the parts per million range, which translates to very low, yet highly effective percentages between 0.0001%–0.005%, although higher or lower amounts may be used depending on the formulary goals. Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-7 is often used as part of a blend with other peptides, such as palmitoyl tripeptide-1. This can produce a nice synergy and offer more targeted results on a wider range of skin concerns. On its own, it is supplied as a powder but in blends it’s combined with hydrators like glycerin, various glycols, triglycerides, or fatty alcohols to make them easier to incorporate into formulas. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel assessed this water-soluble peptide in 2018 alongside other peptides and conclued that this ingredient is safe as used in cosmetics."
Palmitoyl Tetrapeptide-72 Amide,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Supports skin’s tensile strength | Encourages supportive elements in skin | Helps skin maintain a youthful bounce,"Palmitoyl tetrapeptide-72 amide is a synthetic signal peptide made by combining tetrapeptide-72 with a carrier ingredient known as palmitoyl chloride. The building blocks of this peptide are the amino acids alanine, arginine, histidine and tyrosine. Applied to skin, this peptide has clinical data from its supplier indicating that it improves surface firmness and tensile strength. It encourages numerous supportive elements in skin to visibly maintain youthful shape, bounce, and help resist age-related deterioration that results in multiple signs of aging, including first signs of sagging. Think of it as a foundational peptide that provides an organizational framework for skin to look younger. Usage levels of palmitoyl tetrapeptide-72 amide in skin care range from 1–2%, with a smaller portion of this being the peptide itself since the material is supplied as a solution. It’s considered non-irritating and safe for sensitive skin."
Palmitoyl Tripeptide-1,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Helps strengthen skin’s supportive elements | Can minimizing the appearance of wrinkles | Designated as a “signal peptide” | Has the ability to “tell” skin how to look better | Also goes by the names pal-GHK and palmitoyl oligopeptide | Safe history of use in cosmetics,"Palmitoyl tripeptide-1 is a synthetic fatty acid-linked peptide that can help repair visible skin damage and strengthen skin’s underlying supportive elements. It’s categorized as a “signal peptide” because of its ability to “tell” skin how to look better, specifically regarding reducing signs of sun damage like wrinkles and rough texture. Some research has shown that this peptide has similar anti-aging benefits to retinol. (You can use both ingredients for even greater benefits.) Palmitoyl tripeptide-1 also goes by the names pal-GHK and palmitoyl oligopeptide. It appears as a white powder in its raw material form. It is found in a number of cosmetic ingredients alone and in combination with other peptides. In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel looked at personal care products using palmitoyl tripeptide-1 between 0.0000001% to 0.001% and deemed it was safe in current practice of use and concentration. As with most lab-made peptides, a little goes a long way."
Palmitoyl Tripeptide-38,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Peptides","Synthetic peptide that has signaling properties | Plumps, hydrates & improves fullness | Smooths to help the look of lines and wrinkles | Helps support key proteins in skin’s extracellular matrix | Effective at very low use levels as part of a blend","Palmitoyl tripeptide-38 is what’s known as a matrikine-mimetic peptide, a type of lab-engineered (synthetic) signal peptide that mimics the role of matrikines in skin. Matrikines are protein fragments that play a “lock-and-key” role in stimulating collagens, hyaluronic acid, and other extracellular matrix proteins while also helping with collagen repair. Applied to skin, palmitoyl tripeptide-38 helps support key adhesion and communication proteins in skin, visibly improving firmness, smoothness, and, in the case of use on lips, the look of fullness. Other studies relating specifically to palmitoyl tripeptide-38 have shown that it helps improve the appearance of multiple signs of aging, including fine lines, wrinkles, uneven skin tone, and dullness. This research also shows that palmitoyl tripeptide-38 is even more effective in this capacity when combined with other skin-beneficial ingredients such as antioxidants and hyaluronic acid. Speaking of hyaluronic acid, another of palmitoyl tripeptide-38’s benefits is the support of youthful levels of hyaluronic acid in skin and lips, resulting in a plumped, smoothed appearance and better moisture retention. Use levels of palmitoyl tripeptide-38 in skin and lip care is typically 1% when the peptide is a fractional part of a blend due to it being effective in very low (parts per million) amounts."
Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Synthetic tripeptide proven to help aging skin | Improves the look of fine lines and wrinkles | Encourages a firmer look and feel | Helps improve rough texture,"Palmitoyl Tripeptide-5 is a synthetic, patented signal peptide made from the amino acids lysine and valine combined with the fatty acid palmitic acid, which aids penetration. It has a visible impact on skin’s firmness and also helps smooth the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, including deep wrinkles. Peer-reviewed published research has shown that this peptide helps support several components of what’s known as skin’s extracellular matrix, including collagen and hyaluronic acid, so skin looks smoother and more youthful. It can also help inhibit environmentally-generated (as in sun exposure) damaging enzymes in skin that degrade its firmness and resilience. Use levels of palmitoyl tripeptide-5 in cosmetics range from 1–3% as a blend supplied in a water and glycerin base."

Panax Ginseng Root Extract,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","AKA ginseng root extract | Contains numerous antioxidant compounds, including flavonoids | Helps defend skin from pro-aging external aggressors | Topical application of ginseng root boosts skin hydration","Panax ginseng root extract (AKA ginseng) is an antioxidant-rich skin care ingredient that can help defend skin from pro-aging external aggressors and boost hydration. Applied to skin, ginseng root delivers numerous antioxidant compounds, including various flavonoids, as well as being a decent source of B vitamins. Research has also shown that topical application of ginseng root boosts skin hydration, diminishes rough texture, helps fade uneven skin tone and helps visibly improve wrinkles by working within skin to bolster its natural firmness. Panax ginseng root extract is also a popular herbal supplement said to help with all kinds of issues- from enhancing memory and physical stamina to defending against illnesses - there is far more known about how ginseng root works when inside the body (and the research is mixed). The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reviewed Panax ginseng root extract and determined it safe for use in cosmetics. The panel reported that it’s commonly used in cosmetic formulas at concentrations between 0.000002% to 0.5%."

Panthenol,Best,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Humectant, Solvent",Well-known hydrating ingredient | May also help soothe sensitivity | Often referred to as pro-vitamin B5,"Panthenol (sometimes referred to as pro-vitamin B5) is a popular humectant in personal care products due to its ability to attract and hold moisture. When topically applied, it converts to pantothenic acid, which is a naturally occurring substance within the body. Studies show that 1% panthenol quickly increase skin’s hydration, while decreasing transepidermal water loss (the amount of water that evaporates through skin). The overall result is an improvement in the way skin feels and looks, including a more supple appearance. Research also shows promise for panthenol’s ability to reduce sensitivity-induced redness in skin. Topically applied panthenol in amounts between 1-5% has been reported to aid in healing and barrier repair. It’s important to clarify that even though panthenol is the alcohol derivative of pantothenic acid, but it is a completely gentle and non-drying form of alcohol, unlike SD or denatured alcohol, which are known to be damaging to skin. Panthenol is water soluble and “plays well” with many different types of ingredients, making it easy to formulate with for moisturizers, serums, toners, etc. It is also widely used in hair care products and can be found in makeup products, such as powders, mascara, and lipstick. As a raw material, two forms of panthenol can be incorporated in personal care product formulas: D-panthenol is a viscous liquid and DL-panthenol comes in the form of a white, crystalline powder. According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review assessment from 2018, the highest reported concentration of panthenol in a personal care product was 5.3%, which was deemed safe in its use."
Pantothenic Acid,Best,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Humectant, Solvent",,"Also called vitamin B5, research shows it can be effective for hydration. Pantothenic acid occurs naturally in many foods (fresh meats, vegetables, and whole grains), and helps the body convert carbohydrates into glucose that we need for energy. Oral supplementation with pantothenic acid appears to help improve breakouts, but the research on this is not substantial."

On skin, it has been shown to reduce signs of sensitization, including visibly reducing redness. It also helps skin become less sensitive by neutralizing signals in skin's uppermost layers that would otherwise appear as signs of sensitivity.  In order to deliver this peptide to skin and keep it stable during use, it's typically paired with emollient fatty acids such as shea butter or lecithin."
Pentapeptides,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",,"Pentapeptides are a type of peptide where the peptide has five (”penta”) amino acids. There are dozens of pentapeptides used in cosmetic products, with some having more research than others, though most have at least some research from the company that developed and sells the peptide (or peptide blend) to cosmetics companies. Examples of pentapeptides include myristoyl pentapeptide-10 and acetyl pentapeptide-1. Such peptides are theorized to function as skin-restorative ingredients. Still, pentapeptides likely help boost skin’s moisture content and they’re not harmful ingredients."

Skin is composed primarily of a protein known as keratin, so peptides have a role to play as part of a complete skincare routine - though as with any anti-aging ingredient, it’s important to keep your expectations realistic! Ongoing research has shown that all peptides have some amount of skin-restorative ability, assuming the formulation supports the type of peptide used and is packaged to protect it from degrading from light and air exposure during use (no jars!). Ironically, peptides can become unstable in water-based formulas. Further, because peptides are vulnerable to attack by enzymes, the abundant enzymes present in skin can break the peptides down to the point where they have no effect. Knowledge of these inherent weaknesses has led many ingredient manufacturing companies to produce synthetic peptides engineered to be more stable on and within skin. Such peptides can survive intact on skin and better reach their target areas - so you’ll see anti-aging benefits! Some peptides have demonstrated a remarkable skin-soothing effect, while others can improve the appearance of wrinkles, loss of firmness, and even help to soften the look of expression lines. Don’t get seduced by the notion that there’s a best peptide or peptide blend because there isn’t. There are dozens and dozens of remarkable peptides and more being discovered (or made in a lab) every day. Just like antioxidants, skin-soothing ingredients, and skin-replenishing ingredients, there a dozens of brilliant peptides. When all of these elements are combined in a skincare product to address multiple signs of aging, they can do amazing things! But despite claims to the contrary, peptides cannot plumps lips on par with dermal fillers (although they’re getting closer to this result), completely stop sagging skin, work just like cosmetic corrective procedures or entirely eliminate dark circles or puffy eyes. You’ll see all of these claims and more on products with peptides, but such claims are not supported by published, peer-reviewed research."

PHA,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Smooths Bumpy Skin","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Smooths Bumpy Skin, Exfoliant",,"PHA stands for polyhydroxy acid. Ingredients such as gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are polyhydroxy acids. They’re supposed to be as effective as AHAs, but less sensitizing. Gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between them and AHAs is that gluconolactone and lactobionic acid have larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for sensitizing side-effects. Supposedly, this reduced absorption into the skin does not hamper their effectiveness. Does that mean gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are better for your skin than AHAs in the form of glycolic acid or lactic acid? According to an Internet-published class lecture by Dr. Mark G. Rubin, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, research on gluconolactone demonstrated only a “6% decrease in dermal penetration” in comparison to glycolic acid, which “isn’t a dramatic improvement.” Gluconolactone may be slightly less sensitizing for some skin types, but this isn’t the magic bullet for exfoliation some cosmetics companies have been extolling.

Indeed, amounts as low as 0.05% are considered effective. One interesting note of trivia: the name phytosphingosine is derived from the term sphingoid, which was coined in 1884 by chemist J. L. W. Thudichum. The way the molecules of this substance lined up reminded him of the riddle of the mythological Sphinx."

Polydeoxyribonucleotide,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","DNA building block that’s a source of beneficial nucleotides | Signal ingredient with barrier-strengthening, repairing and antioxidant benefits | Can be derived from fish (salmon) or ginseng root | More research is needed to draw firm conclusions on use in professional settings","Polydeoxyribonucleotide (PDRN) is a chemical made up of many (that’s the “poly” part of the name) deoxyribonucleotides. What are deoxyribonucleotides? Good question! They’re the building blocks of DNA, the genetic material of all living organisms. The polynucleotides present in this ingredient are biocompatible with human skin, imparting visible repair, surface regeneration and soothing properties, as verified by tests on skin cells and collagen-creating cells known as fibroblasts. Research has shown that PDRN has dual antioxidant properties: it helps thwart oxidative damage from free radicals and, like superstar antioxidant glutathione, can increase skin’s supply of its own antioxidants, thus revving up its external defenses. It’s also been shown to help repair deeper damage to skin resulting from UV exposure. The appeal of an ingredient derived from fish sperm (usually salmon) is, well, limited. As such, it’s reassuring that there’s a vegan source of polydeoxyribonucleotide to remedy the ick factor some people may feel. Derived from Panax ginseng root, the plant form of PDRN has proven barrier repairing and wound-healing benefits. The salmon-derived form is rich in cell-energizing, anti-aging compound adenosine. The ginseng-derived polydeoxyribonucleotide also contains adenosine in addition to other bio-active compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. Adenosine is the star since it influences multiple signaling pathways that aid visible skin repair, hence its reputation as an anti-aging ingredient. It’s an energizing molecule that helps power many cellular processes that lead to healthier-looking skin. PDRN has also been shown to “connect” with adenosine receptor sites in skin’s uppermost layers. Research has also shown that polydeoxyribonucleotide helps to fade hyperpigmentation when combined with vitamin C and niacinamide and delivered to skin via microneedling. Results were compared with using PDRN alone as well as gold standard ingredient hydroquinone, and the PDRN + vitamin C and niacinamide blend was on par with hydroquinone. Polydeoxyribonucleotide is only available as a cosmetic ingredient as a mixture made of water, butylene glycol and sodium DNA. This explains why you won’t see “polydeoxyribonucleotide” on an ingredient list of a skin care product. Use levels of polydeoxyribonucleotide in cosmetics range from 0.5–2%, with the preponderance of such products coming from Korean skin care brands. Greater amounts are available for use via microneedling from medical spas/aestheticians and dermatologists, where use indications may go beyond cosmetic benefits. Important note: a systematic review of the use of PDRN in medical settings reviewed 16 clinical trials involving 750 patients revealed that although positive results are possible, there were significant data gaps, inconsistencies and other anomalies which kept them from giving an enthusiastic go-ahead for these treatments. The use of PDRN for skin in aesthetic or medical settings is still developing, and long-term safety data is lacking (remember, these in-office treatments typically use greater amounts of PDRN than are found in skin care). PDRN is considered safe as used in cosmetics."

It’s a polymer of the amino acid glutamic acid that’s made via bacterial fermentation using various types of skin-friendly Bacillus, a gram-positive, rod-shaped bacteria. The resulting ingredient has been shown to rival hydrating results of hyaluronic acid; in fact, some studies indicate it surpasses hyaluronic acid, although it does not have that ingredient’s antioxidant or skin-soothing properties, nor is polyglutamic acid naturally found in skin. Although it’s not as well-rounded in the benefits-for-skin department as hyaluronic acid, polyglutamic acid remains a worthwhile ingredient. Just like hyaluronic acid, it’s available in various molecular weights, some capable of penetrating skin’s uppermost layers for multi-level hydration and prevention of water loss that leads to dehydration. Another aspect of polyglutamic acid that it shares with hyaluronic acid is that it forms what’s described as a hydrogel mesh network. This network expands to attract and hold water plus aid delivery of antioxidants (such as quercetin and ferulic acid) to skin that would otherwise prove difficult. Outside the cosmetics industry, polyglutamic acid has gained notoriety for it applications in other fields such as medicine, wastewater treatment, “bio-ink”, and foods. It has replaced or is being studied to replace various other ingredients that are not biodegradable, making polyglutamic acid an environmentally friendly option. Standard usage levels in cosmetics range from 0.05%–1%."

Perlecan is a proteoglycan, meaning a substance that contains a protein and glycosaminoglycan (hyaluronic acid is one). These are involved in keeping communication occurring in skin’s lower layers normalized since this crosstalk tends to breakdown significantly with age, leading to skin that looks dull, fatigued and uneven. Applied to skin, polygonum bistorta root extract visibly revive radiances in a matter of weeks and restore a smoother surface. This includes around the eyes, softening the appearance of lines and wrinkles. As with almost all plant extracts, it’s a good source of antioxidants. However, research has shown it’s a particularly potent antioxidant, rivaling the scavenging properties of vitamin C. It’s also quite soothing and future research may reveal more about how it calms signs of sensitivity. Recommended usage levels of Polygonum bistorta root extract in skin care are 1–3%, where it’s supplied as a liquid combined with glycols."

Also known as Japanese knotweed, Mexican bamboo, and, in Traditional Chinese Medicine as Hu Zhang, this plant not only helps thwart free radicals before they can damage skin, it also reduces signs of irritation. Research has also shown this plant extract can inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end-products, or AGEs. These are collagen-damaging proteins and fats that form in skin as a reaction from exposure to sugars. Left unchecked, AGEs can contribute to wrinkles and loss of firmness. Trans-resveratrol has been shown to fade hyperpigmentation when used in amounts of 1% or more; lower levels of Polygonum cuspidatum root in skin care remain viable for antioxidant, soothing, and other benefits."
Polyhydroxy Acid,Best,"Evens Skin Tone, Smooths Bumpy Skin, Anti-Aging","Evens Skin Tone, Smooths Bumpy Skin, Anti-Aging, Exfoliant",,"Polyhydroxy acids are ingredients such as gluconolactone and lactobionic acid. They’re supposed to be as effective as AHAs, but less sensitizing. Gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are chemically and functionally similar to AHAs (such as glycolic acid). The significant difference between them and AHAs is that gluconolactone and lactobionic acid have larger molecular structures, which limits their ability to penetrate the skin, resulting in less potential for sensitizing side-effects. Supposedly, this reduced absorption into the skin does not hamper their effectiveness. Does that mean gluconolactone and lactobionic acid are better for your skin than AHAs in the form of glycolic acid or lactic acid? According to an Internet-published class lecture by Dr. Mark G. Rubin, a board-certified dermatologist and assistant clinical professor of dermatology at the University of California, San Diego, research on gluconolactone demonstrated only a “6% decrease in dermal penetration” in comparison to glycolic acid, which “isn’t a dramatic improvement.” Gluconolactone may be slightly less sensitizing for some skin types, but this isn’t the magic bullet for exfoliation some cosmetics companies have been extolling. Polyhydroxy acids can also function as antioxidants and may promote some amount of improvement in skin’s surface strength."

Studies have shown that topical use of this edible extract can help offset the damaging cascade on and within skin that’s triggered by UV light exposure. Comparative reports have shown great synergy when Porphyra umbilicalis is paired with vitamins C and E. A key component of this algae’s ability to help protect skin from environmental damage is micosporine like amino acids. These bioactive, heat-stable water-soluble antioxidants (chief among them are palythine, shinorine and porphyra-334) are synthesized by algae to help them survive—and thrive—in harsh environmental conditions such as constant sunlight exposure. Research has proven that micosporine like amino acids have a special ability to neutralize UVA radiation before it can damage the plant. And it turns out this protective benefit applies to skin, making this red algae an excellent addition to sunscreens. Helping to offset UVB damage is also in this red algae’s bag of tricks. Topical use of Porphyra umbilicalis has also been shown to reduce UV-triggered redness and help prevent water loss (dehydration) in environmentally-exposed skin. Along with the micosporine like amino acids, other antioxidant compounds in this type of red algae include vitamins C and E, lutein, chlorophyll, beta-carotene, and fucoxanthin. This algae also contains minerals, hydrating polysaccharides, and peptides that may play a role in skin’s renewal. Recommended use levels of Porphyra umbilicalis extract in skin care range from 1–4% as supplied in a water base. The 2021 Cosmetic Ingredient Review assessment of red algae-derived ingredients deemed Porphyra umbilicalis extract safe in the present practices of use and concentrations described in their report. There is no limit on the concentration of use."

This golden or green-colored plant has skin-soothing properties and is a potent antioxidant thanks to its high amounts of vitamins A (as beta-carotene), C, and E (alpha-tocopherol) as well as other antioxidant compounds such as glutathione. The antioxidants in purslane work to address numerous skin concerns, including wrinkles and other signs of aging. Purslane is also a very good source of skin-beneficial minerals like potassium, magnesium, calcium, and phosphorous, plus omega-3 fatty acids, amino acids, and hydrating sugars known as polysaccharides. Another beneficial component of purslane is its genistein content, which can help rejuvenate skin that has become lax and crepey. Although not commonly consumed as part of most Western diets, the nutritional profile of this plant ranks it as a true superfood. Ongoing research is consistently showing this plant has remarkable benefits for the skin and body. Recommended usage levels of Portulaca oleracea in skin care ranges from 1–3% of the pure plant and 1–5% if it’s part of a blend. It is not known to be irritating or otherwise problematic for skin, although a formal safety assessment of this plant has yet to be conducted. Fun fact: Purslane is native to India and Persia but is naturally found in regions all over the world including Asia, Africa, America, Europe and Australia. It also has a history of use in Chinese and Korean medicine."

Of significance, potassium azeloyl diglycinate plays a role in reducing the appearance of redness and discomfort associated with sensitive skin. Potassium azeloyl diglycinate is a water-soluble ingredient obtained from the condensation of azelaic acid mixed with glycine. The glycine gives it a hydrating/moisturizing effect that helps improve conditions for compromised skin. Simultaneously, potassium azeloyl diglycinate has the ability to normalize and in turn help minimize excess oil in skin. This can help with skin issues associated the overproduction of sebum (think clogged pores, breakouts, etc.). More research is necessary to determine the concentration range needed to produce optimal results, but from the studies currently available as well as information from ingredient suppliers, we can conclude that a 0.5% concentration is beneficial for soothing skin, while amounts between 2-3% can help fade skin discolorations and influence sebum."
Potassium PCA,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant","Mineral electrolyte that plays an influential role in skin’s natural moisturizing factor | Helps facilitate water pathways within skin, ensuring balanced hydration levels | Aids in reinforcing skin’s barrier | Helps optimizes skin’s desquamation (shedding) process","Potassium PCA is the potassium salt of PCA (pyrrolidone carboxylic acid), a substance that’s a natural part of skin’s intercellular matrix. Potassium PCA therefore plays an influential role in what’s known as skin’s natural moisturizing factor (NMF). Potassium is one of the minerals that helps facilitate water pathways within skin, ensuring balanced hydration levels. In fact, when skin loses potassium, as it does when we sweat, it can look and feel drier.

While the body can produce proline, its synthesis can be limited by certain physiological circumstances, which has led some scientists to refer to proline as a conditionally essential amino acid. In those circumstances, it must be consumed as part of a person’s diet for them to obtain the proper amount. Like all amino acids, proline helps skin retain moisture, adding to a supple look and feel. It also helps support structures that prevent the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. As an amino acid, it is considered safe as used in cosmetics; in fact, proline is part of many peptides used in skin care.

Protease,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Exfoliant","Name for a diverse group of enzymes | Found in animals, plants, bacteria, and fungi | Break down proteins and peptides | Help skin shed old and damaged tissue","Protease is perhaps better known by its plural form proteases or as proteolytic enzymes. The name protease covers a large number of enzymes that break down proteins and peptides into shorter peptides or amino acids. These enzymes are made by plants, animals, fungi, and bacteria. In the human body proteases function to inhibit the function of certain proteins, break down inactive proteins into active peptides, and serve as an agent to kickstart certain biological processes. In the world of dermatology, proteases have been used in cleansers to remove “dirt” proteins (as in the proteins naturally found in soil) from skin. In leave-on formulations, proteases can help remove old, dead skin cells to reduce skin flaking and help moisturizers work better to restore skin’s barrier, particularly if it’s naturally deficient in the proteins that help keep it strong. In essence, proteases help skin’s surface with the natural process of desquamation – also known as exfoliation. Extensive research has not been conducted yet showing how effective proteases are in direct comparison to “chemical” exfoliates such as AHAs and BHA. Still, these ingredients are helpful in maintaining skin’s normal balance, which is always a good thing. Rather than replacing chemical exfoliants, using products with proteases can help boost their skin-renewing properties."

Prunus Lannesiana (Cherry Blossom) Flower Extract,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","Derived from the ornamental cherry blossom tree. | Helps interrupt the visible damage from advanced glycation end-products. | Capable of soothing irritated, compromised skin. | Helps protect skin from oxidative damage due to UVB light.","Prunus lannesiana (cherry blossom) flower extract is derived from the ornamental cherry blossom tree that’s native to east Asia, most notably Japan. The pink-to-white flowers are believed to be a sign of good fortune but it’s benefit for skin is due to antioxidant compounds, including anthocyanins, flavonoids, caffeic acid, and quercertin derivatives. Research has revealed cherry blossom flowers applied to skin can help inhibit advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), collagen damaging compounds that also put skin at increased risk for hyperpigmentation. Reducing these compounds influence on skin’s uppermost layers will help keep skin looking youthful and even-toned. In vitro and in vivo tests have shown that cherry blossom extract offers soothing properties. A 2% concentration of this extract helped reduce signs of irritation from skin exposed to strong detergents and other irritants. Lower concentrations of this extract were shown to help protect skin cells from free radical damage when exposed to UVB light. Usage levels of Prunus lannesiana (cherry blossom) flower extract are typically 1–3% where it’s part of a water-based blend. The actual content of this specific extract lower, a testament to this antioxidant’s potency on skin. This ingredient is sometimes referred to as Sakura or Japanese Cherry. Note: Although cherry blossom flowers are fragrant for a time, the form Paula’s Choice Skincare uses is a bio-fermented extract that does not retain fragrance ingredients that could irritate skin."

Punica Granatum Pericarp Extract,Best,"Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","Commonly known as pomegranate peel | Incredibly rich source of potent antioxidants | Helps maintain healthy-looking, firmer-feeling skin | Helps skin better utilize retinoids while reducing irritation","Punica granatum pericarp extract is another name for pomegranate peel. The peel from this brightly colored fruit is its first line of defense, so it’s not surprising to find out that this is where the highest concentration of antioxidants resides. The pericarp’s antioxidant mix includes phenolics, flavonoids, ellagitannins, ellagic acid and proanthocyanidins, all of which help preserve healthy, youthful-looking skin by virtue of neutralizing damaging free radicals and thwarting the inflammation they’d otherwise cause on skin. The antioxidant compounds found throughout pomegranate pericarp also have pronounced soothing properties which help offset pathways that trigger signs of sensitivity. When paired with retinoids, Punica granatum pericarp extract helps skin better utilize these ingredients, essentially making sure they’re working in a more timely, efficient manner, which reduces the risk of retinoid irritation. Use levels of Punica granatum pericarp extract in cosmetics are typically 0.1–1% when used in a water-based blend. It’s considered safe and non-sensitizing for skin. Environmental note: Pomegranate pericarp (peel) is considered an upcycled ingredient as used in cosmetics. That’s because the inedible peel is usually discarded when pomegranates are used for their seed oils or arils."

It occurs naturally in grapes (so it is also found in red wine), tea, onions, kale, tomatoes, berries, and many other fruits and vegetables, with the highest concentrations found in the leaves and skins. It functions as an antioxidant, skin-soothing agent, and restorative ingredient. In terms of skin care, research has shown that a lipid-based (fat-based) delivery system is optimal for quercetin to exert antioxidant benefits. Even more exciting, this type of formula provides an initial burst of quercetin followed by sustained release over a 24-hour period. When quercetin is mixed with silicone and lipids, the intake is greater, as confirmed by testing on human skin. Emerging research also shows quercetin has protective effects against ultraviolet-B (UVB) radiation, though quercetin is not approved as an active sunscreen ingredient. Higher amounts of quercetin impart a pale yellow to golden color to cosmetics."
Rambutan,Best,"Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Extract derived from the tropical fruit rambutan (cousin to lychee) | The peel portion is particularly rich in skin-beneficial antioxidants | Proven to visibly improve signs of aging & sun damage | Shows potential for supporting skin’s natural supply of collagen | Exhibits soothing properties,"Nephelium lappaceum , commonly known as rambutan, is a tropical hairy fruit native to Southeast Asia. In recent years, rambutan has gained attention as a promising skin care ingredient due to its rich content of antioxidants, including ellagic acid and quercetin, which can deliver anti-aging and soothing benefits for skin. Rambutan extracts also show potential for supporting skin’s natural supply of collagen and inhibiting discoloration before it becomes visible. In particular, the peel portion of rambutan is especially rich in antioxidants, with reports showing rambutan peel extract (a.k.a. Nephelium lappaceum peel extract) offers significant protection to help offset the visible signs of photoaging/sun damage. Furthermore, studies suggest incorporating rambutan peel extract into sunscreen formulations can help enhance the SPF. Some skin care brands tout rambutan as a natural alternative to retinol. While both ingredients offer anti-aging benefits, they work through different mechanisms. Retinol binds to specific receptors in skin cells, while rambutan does not. This difference in action means that retinol can produce more dramatic results than rambutan. Think of rambutan as a complementary partner to retinol/retinoids rather than a direct replacement. The safety of Nephelium lappaceum (rambutan) extract has not yet been officially assessed by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel. However, a 2017 study published in the Annals of the Brazilian Academy of Sciences found that Nephelium lappaceum peel extract was safe when tested on human skin fibroblasts. Worth noting, rambutan extracts have great potential for sustainable usage within the cosmetics industry. When rambutan is processed for food products, such as jams, juices, and canned fruit, large quantities of peel and seed by-products are generated. These by-products can be “upcycled” and used to produce rambutan extract for skin care and other personal care products."

It is considered one of the key herbs used in traditional Chinese medicine, especially for internal ailments. A growing body of research is demonstrating that Rehmannia glutinosa root extract is an ingredient to watch when it comes to topical skin treatment as well. While its antioxidant properties protect skin from environmental aggressors, one of its hallmark traits appears to be its ability to fight factors that can trigger visible signs of irritation. One study even found that Rehmannia glutinosa root extract can help mitigate visible signs of aging due to estrogen loss – making it an intriguing ingredient to consider for anti-aging formulas meant for menopausal skin. Usage levels of Rehmannia glutinosa root extract have not been firmly established for cosmetics."

Applied topically, resveratrol helps protect skin’s surface and rebuffs negative environmental influences. Among its many significant benefits, resveratrol and its derivatives have been shown to visibly minimize hyperpigmented skin discolorations and slow down the process of photoaging in skin. Studies also indicate formulations with resveratrol can support healthy collagen and it is known as to be “phytoestrogen” ingredient, which can help with issues related to estrogen deficiency/menopause, such as crepey, lax skin. Additionally, resveratrol has skin-calming properties that may help minimize the look of redness. Resveratrol concentrations in skin care typically range from 0.5-1% when the goal is fading discolorations and reducing other signs of aging; however, lower amounts (such as 0.04%) may be used simply to impart antioxidant benefits, especially alongside other notable antioxidants in a formula."
Retinal,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Oil Control","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Oil Control, Antioxidant, Retinoids",AKA retinaldehyde | A direct anti-aging precursor to retinoic acid | Helps improve the look of blemish-prone skin | Reduces look of fine lines and wrinkles | Requires one less conversion step in skin compared to pure retinol to become its active form | Tolerated equally well or in some cases even better compared to pure retinol,"Retinal (also referred to as retinaldehyde) is a form of retinol that is a direct precursor to retinoic acid, which is what retinol breaks down once its absorbed by skin. This vitamin A derivative is well-documented with decades of research backing its skin care benefits, including the ability to visibly reduce fine lines and wrinkles, as well as mitigating other signs of aging, including hyperpigmentation. Studies show retinal can also help improve the appearance of blemish-prone skin by helping to offset underlying triggers. Those with excessively oily skin may also find retinal helps balance their sebum excretion on skin’s surface. This combination of benefits provides a unique advantage for retinal to tackle multiple stubborn skin concerns at once. While it was long ago theorized that retinal may be more likely to sensitize skin than pure retinol, newer research has shown it is tolerated equally well or in some cases even better, as it requires one less conversion step in skin to become its active form. Formulary innovations, including encapsulation of the ingredient, can further enhance skin’s tolerance of retinal, while also improving stability and performance. Similar to retinol, retinal does not need to be used in large concentrations to be effective. Concentrations as low as 0.05% have been proven to be effective for improving skin texture and in 0.1% concentration results for skin tone improvement have been documented, among other benefits. While retinal is considered a safe skin care ingredient overall, it should not be used during pregnancy due to its relation to prescription retinoids (always consult your physician)."
Retinoids,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Pore Minimizer","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Pore Minimizer, Antioxidant, Retinoids","Umbrella term used for vitamin A derivatives | Have been widely used since the 1970s | Skin-communicating and skin-restoring ingredients | Includes retinol, retinaldehyde and tretinoin among many others","Retinoids are powerhouse skin-restoring ingredients used in skin care products for their anti-aging, firming, tone-evening and pore-minimizing benefits. Long recognized and researched, these vitamin A derivatives have a track record of proven effectiveness and also function as antioxidants. Although many think the terms “retinoid” and “retinol” are one and the same, they’re not. “Retinoid” is an umbrella term under which all vitamin A derivatives live. “Retinol” is an ingredient that sits under this umbrella, making it a retinoid. All retinoids must convert to retinoic acid in order for skin to be able to use them. The number of steps that a retinoid must take to reach retinoic acid varies from retinoid to retinoid, and how gently this occurs can be a highly individualized experience. Retinoids splashed onto the skin care scene in the 1970s with the arrival and US Food and Drug Administration approval of tretinoin (AKA Retin-A). Although this prescription retinoid is still widely used, more retinoids have since reached the mainstream, including: adapalene, retinaldehyde, retinyl palmitate and retinyl propionate, all available over-the-counter. This group of ingredients coaches skin on how to act younger, encouraging the visible firming of skin’s architecture, improving surface cell turnover and helping skin hold on to the essential substances it needs to look and feel healthy, amongst many other things. Individual retinoids can also accomplish other feats based on their structure, concentration and other ingredients used in the same formula. Retinoids appear as both prescription drugs and over-the-counter products, depending on which vitamin A derivative is utilized and its concentration. Beyond topical application, certain retinoids are also supplied as oral medications (like isotretinoin AKA Accutane). As raw materials, they have a distinct yellow color. Because they’re antioxidants, retinoids must be packaged in airtight, opaque packaging to prevent ingredient degradation."
Retinol,Best,"Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Pore Minimizer","Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Pore Minimizer, Antioxidant, Retinoids",Name for the entire vitamin A molecule | Research proves its anti-aging abilities | Helps tell skin how to look and behave younger | Effective at several strengths,"Retinol is the name for the entire vitamin A molecule. This powerhouse ingredient has more than 70 years of established studies showing it has value for skin on several fronts: It’s a skin-restoring, wrinkle-smoothing, firming and pore-refining ingredient and an antioxidant, allowing it to improve a variety of skin concerns, most related to visible signs of aging. Retinol delivers its long list of visible results because of the way it uniquely communicates with skin cells and influences various pathways, effectively “telling” skin how to look and act younger. For instance, recent research shows retinol can jump-start skin’s production of hyaluronic acid, resulting in a plumper, more hydrated appearance. Packaging is a key issue, so any container that lets in air (like jar packaging) or sunlight (clear containers) just won’t cut it. Lots of retinol products come in unacceptable packaging; these should be avoided because the retinol will most likely be (or quickly become) ineffective. Only purchase retinol products sold in opaque, airless, or air-restrictive packaging. Many consumers are concerned about the percentage of retinol in anti-aging products such as serums or moisturizers. Although the percentage can make a difference (larger amounts of retinol, generally considered 3% or higher, are used in clinical settings for more dramatic results), it’s not helpful in understanding how a retinol product will benefit your skin. Studies have shown even small amounts (as low as 0.01%) of retinol can make an impact in the appearance of visible signs of aging. Far more important is the delivery system, packaging, and the other ingredients present with the retinol. Using a product with a range of anti-aging ingredients plus retinol is far more valuable for skin than using a product with only a supposedly high percentage of retinol. Skin needs far more than any one ingredient can provide, however great that one ingredient may be. There are several myths about using retinol with other anti-aging ingredients or products, such as those with vitamin C or exfoliants like glycolic acid."

Retinyl Palmitate,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Retinoids","Combination of retinol and fatty acid palmitic acid | Found naturally in skin and is the most abundant form of vitamin A storage in animals | Works as an antioxidant, preventing visible signs of aging","Retinyl palmitate is a combination of retinol (pure vitamin A) and the fatty acid palmitic acid. Research has shown it to be an effective antioxidant when applied to skin. You may be surprised to learn that retinyl palmitate is found naturally in our skin (it is the most abundant form of vitamin A storage in animals), where it works as an antioxidant, particularly for helping to protect skin from UV light exposure—though it does not replace the need for sunscreen, and is it not approved by the U.S. FDA as a sunscreen active ingredient. Reports that retinyl palmitate is not a safe ingredient are false. They’re based on a study from nearly 20 years ago that has never been reproduced or tested under real-life conditions such as how people use sunscreens that contain this ingredient. In addition, to date, there is no scientific evidence that retinyl palmitate is a carcinogen in humans. The safety of retinyl palmitate is supported by several accredited organizations, including the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel, which has ruled several times that retinyl palmitate is safe as currently used in cosmetics. Usage levels of retinyl palmitate typically run from 0.1–0.5%, where it’s often combined with other antioxidant vitamins such as various forms of vitamins C and E."
Retinyl Propionate,Best,"Anti-Acne, Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Pore Minimizer","Anti-Acne, Anti-Aging, Dark Spot Fading, Evens Skin Tone, Pore Minimizer, Antioxidant, Retinoids","Stable, synthetic derivative of vitamin A | Has an impressive synergy with niacinamide | Offers the same benefits of retinol | Gentler than pure retinol","Retinyl propionate is a synthetic ester derivative of vitamin A, made from pure retinol and propionic acid, a type of carboxylic acid that’s considered a volatile fatty acid. This combination makes for a more stable retinoid that has a longer half-life, meaning it takes longer for the ingredient to be metabolized, allowing for a longer stretch of efficacy. This form of vitamin A has demonstrated all the same benefits of retinol, including visible reduction of fine lines and deep wrinkles, improvement of uneven skin tone, refining signs of enlarged pores, and fading the look of discolorations from sun exposure. Research has demonstrated that most people tend to tolerate retinyl propionate better than retinol; however, if your skin tolerates retinol it remains one of the gold standard anti-aging ingredients to consider. Part of the reason for this greater tolerance is that the conversion of retinyl propionate to retinoic acid happens differently and more slowly than it does for retinol. This has to do with how retinyl propionate interacts with specific receptor sites within skin’s uppermost layers. Usage levels of retinyl propionate in skin care range from 0.1–0.4%. It is often paired with niacinamide because this B vitamin enhances the stability and bioavailability of retinyl propionate."
Retinyl Retinoate,Best,"Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Pore Minimizer","Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Pore Minimizer, Antioxidant, Retinoids",,"Retinyl retinoate is a synthetic, “new generation” retinol with research showing its usefulness for restoring and improving signs of aging in skin. Retinyl retinoate has been shown, in limited but promising research (most coming from the same team of Korea-based researchers), to be less sensitizing than retinoic acid (prescription-strength) and cosmetic retinol. Retinyl retinoate may be less sensitizing than pure retinol because of its slower conversion in skin to retinoic acid. However, when it comes to sensitivity from retinol, there’s much that can be done using time-release delivery systems and ingredient additions to maximize its benefits to skin while minimizing, if not eliminating, its risk of sensitivity. Although there’s reason to consider retinyl retinoate if your skin seems intolerant of cosmetic retinol, it shouldn’t be construed as better or safer for skin than such alternatives."

It plays a variety of roles in skin care formulations, including functioning as a prebiotic, which serves as an energy source for skin’s probiotics to thrive and restore a healthy microbiome balance. This ultimately keeps the surface of skin and its barrier stronger in the face of environmental threats. Additionally, a study funded by L’Oreal demonstrated a 5% concentration of rhamnose had a positive impact on epidermal thickness and collagen. Independent studies are needed to validate these findings, although existing research shows promise for rhamnose as an anti-aging ingredient in other capacities (specifically in its role to inhibit advanced glycation end products, also known as AGEs, which degrade skin’s firm look). Rhamnose also exhibits skin-soothing benefits and its humectant properties boost skin’s hydration. In 2019, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed rhamnose safe as used in personal care products. Their report looked at products containing up to 10% concentration. As a raw material, rhamnose is a water-soluble crystalline powder. It’s often combined with other prebiotic sugars such as fructose and various oligosaccharides."

Black currants have been used for centuries as a food and flavor source, appearing in everything from jams and jellies to syrups and alcoholic beverages. This type of berry also has numerous benefits when applied to skin. Its oil is abundant in antioxidant polyphenols and tocopherols (vitamin E derivatives) that fight the free-radical radical damage that leads to numerous visible signs of aging. In addition, this non-fragrant plant oil offers moisturizing and barrier repairing linolenic acid, making it a good choice for those with dry or compromised skin. Use levels of black currant seed oil in cosmetics haven’t been firmly established, but there’s no reason not to apply to skin at up to a 100% concentration if desired.

Rose hip oil’s long been used in skin care and cosmetics for its hydrating benefits. This is mainly thanks to the fatty acids, linoleic acid and oleic acid, which are present in this emollient oil. Both work to help hydrate and soften the skin by preventing moisture from escaping from the skin’s surface barrier. Tocopherols and phenolic compounds that contain antioxidant properties are found in rose hip oil as well. Due to these antioxidant superstars, the oil additionally assists in protecting skin from aging environmental stressors, helping skin to preserve a youthful look. On the flip side, due to its antioxidant properties, this oil’s susceptible to degradation when exposed to air and light. That’s why it’s important to look for formulas containing rose hip oil in light- and air-protective packaging. Rose hip oil’s clearly a multi-tasking ingredient, with further research currently exploring the ingredient’s ability to soothe and help even skin tone. Cosmetic manufacturers produce the oil through the cold pressing of seed pods, also referred to as the “fruit” of plants from the Rosa genus, namely Rosa canina.

Unlike other emollient plant oils, this seed oil has a lightweight texture. Rubus idaeus seed oil is rich in fatty acids, including linoleic and oleic acids. Fatty acids primarily work as emollients, preventing water loss and improving hydration; however, they also have skin-soothing and barrier-restorative properties; for example, linoleic acid is required for skin to make its own ceramides, which comprise 50% of its barrier. This seed oil also contains a multitude of antioxidant compounds like vitamin E and vitamin A, which helps protect skin from pro-aging external aggressors and helps reduce the appearance of signs of aging (wrinkles, sun damage, fine lines). Due to Rubus idaeus seed oil’s protective nature against UV rays, clean and natural beauty circles have come to laud it as an alternative to mineral and synthetic sunscreens. Although this ingredient does offer protection against UV rays, research has proven that it is minimal at best. A study conducted in 2021 on the SPF rating of plant oils revealed that Rubus idaeus seed oil had a measly SPF of 2.6 in vivo. The American Academy of Dermatology Association recommends usage of a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF rating of at least 30. Simply stated, Rubus idaeus seed oil alone isn’t an adequate source of UV protection nor is it an FDA approved sunscreen filter. Using this ingredient alone or in DIY sunscreen mixtures will not provide nearly enough protection. Seek out approved sunscreen filters, like titanium dioxide and avobenzone, for appropriate UV ray protection. As a raw material, Rubus idaeus seed oil presents as a yellow liquid. In cosmetics, this ingredient is commonly used at concentration levels between 0.1% and 5.0%. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has deemed this ingredient as safe."

Saccharide Isomerate,Best,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",Humectant derived from plant sugars | Attracts and hold moisture as it soothes | Has a natural affinity for skin,"Saccharide isomerate is a complex mixture of hydrating corn-derived sugars which have moisture-binding (humectant) properties. The sugars are then isomerized, a process in which rearranges molecular structure to change the way a substance works and/or the results it has. In this case, the result closely matches the carbohydrates naturally present in skin’s natural moisturizing factor, NMF. This gives saccharide isomerate a natural affinity for skin, allowing it to provide prolonged hydration. Because of its small molecular structure, saccharide isomerate can provide moisturization deeper in the skin than hyaluronic acid. As such, it complements the moisturizing benefits of hyaluronic acid, which works primarily on the surface of skin. Research indicates saccharide isomerate has an affinity for soothing and strengthening skin’s barrier by influencing key proteins skin’s uppermost layers need to ensure a smooth, intact surface that’s less vulnerable to environmental aggressors such as airborne pollutants. Usage levels based on clinical data on human skin range from 0.6–3%. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics and is most beneficial when used in leave-on formulas."

Because salicylic acid is oil soluble, it also has the ability to penetrate into the pore lining and exfoliate inside the pore. This makes it especially effective for reducing breakouts, including blackheads and whiteheads. Salicylic acid is recognized as an over-the-counter topical acne product by the U.S. FDA, when used in concentrations of 0.5-2%. Even though salicylic acid is best known for its ability to address acne-prone skin concerns, it offers many additional properties that any skin type can benefit from. Case in point, by exfoliating the buildup of dead skin on the surface, it also helps reverse the appearance of dull, uneven skin tone, as well as other visible signs of aging skin. Unlike physical exfoliants (such as a rough facial scrub), salicylic acid offers hydrating properties that enhance the result of smooth, soft skin. Another unique advantage is salicylic acid’s ability to gently soothe aggravated skin thanks to its inherent calming properties. Salicylic acid works most effectively as a leave-on treatment, ideally within a pH range between 3 and 4. Rinse-off salicylic acid cleansers typically have a higher pH, which likely won’t offer much of an exfoliation benefit, not to mention the contact time with skin is very brief - but the salicylic acid may at least offer skin-calming benefits in this form and can be included in amounts as low as 0.5% to achieve this benefit. Research shows using salicylic acid starting at a 1-2% concentration is recommended for regular exfoliation within a skin care routine. For more stubborn concerns, higher concentrations can make a dramatic difference. In dermatologic practices, salicylic acid has been safely used in as high as 50% concentrations for removal of warts, corns, pigmented lesions, and other advanced concerns. Salicylic acid has been found to be safe on all skin tones and ethnicities."

Schizophyllan for skin care is made via fermentation of liquefied mushrooms which are then highly purified. Research has shown that schizophyllan excels at reducing signs of irritated skin. It’s also a good antioxidant, capable of neutralizing damage from airborne pollutants such as smoke. Interestingly, vitamin C (as sodium ascorbyl phosphate) performed better in all-around antioxidant ability when compared to several polysaccharides, including schizophyllan; however, researchers noted its calming ability and suspect it also helps boost skin’s endogenous (naturally occurring) supply of antioxidants. Due to its strong water-binding (humectant) properties, schizophyllan is said to maintain skin’s hydration when under stress better than a similar amount of hyaluronic acid. Of note, more studies are needed to confirm this result. Its antioxidant ability and mild film-forming properties support a firmer look and feel for skin, making schizophyllan a mushroom derivative that can help reduce signs of aging.

However, even though tea flavonoids are effective antioxidants, it is unclear to what extent they increase the antioxidant capacity of humans. It appears that white and green teas have similar amounts of the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the main antioxidant in tea. The conclusion is that white and green tea have nearly identical antioxidant activity, and both are great antixoidants to look for in skincare products."

Depending on the extraction method (ethanol vs. cold-pressed), this seed oil is a rich source of numerous types of antioxidants known as polyphenols. Chief among them is silymarin, which contains flavonolignans. These are what’s responsible for silymarin’s soothing, reparative benefits when applied to skin. These antioxidants also give this plant ingredient the ability to neutralize highly damaging hydroxyl radicals that can form when skin is exposed to UV light. Silymarin and other compounds in this seed oil can help inhibit destructive enzymes in skin’s uppermost layers that would otherwise damage collagen, elastin, and hyaluronic acid, leading to visibly aged skin. Silymarin and its derivative silybin have also been shown to visibly reduce dark spots. Studies looking at concentrations between 0.7–1.4% in creams have shown topical application of milk thistle can help fade discoloration from sun exposure and other sources without adverse effects. Some research indicates that extraction via ethanol is preferred because when cold-pressed, the seed oil’s silymarin content is lower. However, cold pressing releases more of the silymarin derivative silybin, which is an even more potent antioxidant and skin soother than silymarin. Either method provides a good source of alpha tocopherol (vitamin E), phospholipids, and squalene as well as polyphenols such as vanillic acid and p-coumaric."

It has been shown to enhance skin’s restorative properties and can also provide topical skin-soothing benefits. Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil is a rich source of numerous fatty acids and antioxidants. The texture of Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil is similar to the sebum (oil) human skin produces, which makes it a brilliant ingredient for dry skin but potentially problematic for those with oily skin prone to clogged pores and breakouts. The molecular size of jojoba seed oil lets it penetrate the pore lining where it can mix with skin’s own oil and potentially lead to or worsen clogs. Jojoba wax is considered more of an issue for breakout-prone skin than jojoba oil due to the more solidifying nature of wax. Simmondsia chinensis (jojoba) seed oil has the distinction of feeling lighter and less greasy than many other oils, particularly highly saturated oils such as coconut. It is one of the more stable plant oils in use today. Unlike many other plant-derived oils, jojoba seed oil is considered inedible due to a component known as simmondsin which interferes with the absorption of nutrients from food. Note that this effect occurs via an interaction with digestive chemicals in the intestines, not via topical absorption since it is metabolized within skin. Simmondsin is largely responsible for the soothing properties jojoba oil has on skin."

Skin conditioning ingredients include natural and synthetic emollients, humectants, and occlusive agents. Emollients refer to ingredients that hydrate skin, while humectants are ingredients that attract moisture to skin, and occlusive ingredients form a protective barrier on skin to defend it from damage. You’ll see these types of ingredients in all well-formulated moisturizers, as they form the foundation for good skin care products that boost and restore skin’s barrier. If your skin is very dry, you will see a decrease in the tight feeling that can come after cleansing and an alleviation of rough, flaky texture. These ingredients aren’t only for dry skin, though; all skin types benefit from conditioning ingredients (though if your skin is very oily, you will want to avoid very occlusive ingredients and stick to more lightweight skin conditioners, such as hyaluronic and polyglutamic acids).

At first used in Korean beauty (or K-beauty) products, it is now gaining popularity in skin care formulations worldwide. This ingredient is found in Protelixan PF manufactured by Cobiosa and distributed by MMP International in the US and Canada. Research finds that far from being a fad, there is benefit in topical application of snail secretion filtrate. The secretion contains numerous skin-friendly ingredients, including elastin, collagen, allantoin, glycolic acid, antioxidants, and even peptides. A growing number of studies are showing that snail secretion filtrate helps mitigate multiple signs of aging, especially visible damage caused by years of unprotected exposure to the sun. Usage levels of snail secretion filtrate hover between 2–5%. One note: the snail secretion filtrate extraction process is considered non-harmful to the snails, since the secretions (which are essentially a byproduct) are humanely collected from live specimens.

Sodium acetylated hyaluronate is the acetyl ester of sodium hyaluronate, where some of hyaluronic acid’s hydroxyl groups are replaced with acetyl groups. This swap in groups allows for enhanced bioavailability and better stability, increasing benefits since this allows for penetration deeper into skin and lets the ingredient reach its destination sooner . While hydrating and plumping skin, sodium acetylated hyaluronate also assists in mitigating environmental damage and visibly reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, making it an interesting ingredient to explore further for its anti-aging properties. It’s most commonly used in leave-on skin care products in percentages between 0.002 and 0.1%.

Just like pure vitamin C, sodium ascorbyl phosphate functions as an antioxidant on and within skin. When used in higher amounts, it can be effective for brightening a dull skin tone, smoothing wrinkles, visibly firming skin, and reducing discolorations. The usual concentration of sodium ascorbyl phosphate in skin care ranges from 0.2-3%, an effective range to help improve skin’s environmental defenses and target lines and wrinkles, especially when paired with oil-soluble vitamin E for antioxidant synergy that improves the stability of both ingredients. A 5% concentration of sodium ascorbyl phosphate was shown in a comparative study with the same amount of ascorbic acid to have equivalent wrinkle-smoothing and elasticity-increasing benefit to skin around the eyes. Amounts above 3% are considered necessary to target discolorations, similar to the range research has shown ascorbic acid works within to target this concern. There is also research showing amounts of 1% and 5% concentrations of sodium ascorbyl phosphate can influence factors linked to breakouts, likely due to its skin soothing effect. Thus, this form of vitamin C may be an effective adjunct to anti-acne products that contain benzoyl peroxide and salicylic acid. Along with other forms of vitamin C, it is considered safe as used in skin care products. This versatile form of vitamin C works in both water- and oil-based formulas without breaking down, but despite this impressive stability, packaging is still important. This is because such stability isn’t impenetrable, meaning ongoing exposure to light and air can still weaken its efficacy, although certainly not as quickly as occurs with pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid)."

It shares the same benefits as hyaluronic acid, including its remarkable ability to help skin retain a lot of moisture - one gram (or 0.03 oz.) of hyaluronic acid can hold up to six liters of water. Used on skin, it doesn’t hold that much water; instead, as a smart ingredient, sodium hyaluronate helps skin maintain water balance, which is critical to its healthy appearance. In addition to its moisture-binding (humectant) properties, sodium hyaluronate is also considered a postbiotic, meaning it can help nourish and maintain skin’s microbiome. The chief difference between hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate is that sodium hyaluronate is more bioavailable - meaning skin more readily absorbs it than hyaluronic acid. This doesn’t necessarily mean it’s better than hyaluronic acid, merely that many skin care products contain both forms, so your skin sees maximum benefits. Both hyaluronic acid and sodium hyaluronate are available in different molecular weights for multi-level results (lower molecular weight can penetrate deeper into skin’s layers, where higher weights deliver immediate results on the surface)."

Sodium lauroyl oat amino acids may also be found in hair conditioners, shampoos, and anti-static products. In 2017, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed sodium lauroyl oat amino acids safe for cosmetic use. Their report surveyed 98 personal care products containing up to 5% concentration of sodium lauroyl oat amino acids. Amounts of 2–5% are common in cosmetics, but some suppliers recommend usage levels up to 20% depending on formulary goals. This ingredient may be naturally or synthetically derived.

Similar to glycerin, it is a hydrating ingredient (technically a humectant), texture enhancer, and stabilizer. Its sugar component makes sorbitol an intriguing prebiotic, an ingredient that can “feed” the probiotics that make up a person’s skin microbiome, thus helping it become balanced. Specifically, sorbitol’s breakdown by certain probiotics can create beta-glucan, a skin-calming antioxidant. Newer research is showing that sorbitol is a useful addition to delivery systems that enhance the penetration and stability of natural antioxidants. Typical usage levels of sorbitol in skin care range from 5–50%, with amounts between 0.2–3.6% used in makeup, including powders. Sorbitol is considered safe as used in cosmetics. In fact, in the United States it has GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status as a food additive. From the safety report: “When used in foods, sorbitol may not exceed 99% in hard candy and cough drops, 75% in chewing gum, 98% in soft candy, 30% in non-standardized jams and jellies, 30% in baked goods and baking mixes, 17% in frozen dairy desserts, and 12% in all other foods.”"

They are sometimes referred to as phytoestrogens*. Of note, studies have shown that soy isoflavones help safely counteract certain signs of changes skin goes through during menopause, which are attributed to declining levels of estrogen. They do so by safely binding with receptors in skin’s surface layers to support the areas that estrogen loss has affected in a way that other cosmetic ingredients cannot. This includes having a positive visible impact on skin’s elasticity, texture, density, resilience and hydration. Because soy isoflavones are potent antioxidants, they help neutralize negative effects of environmental stressors, while simultaneously supporting key processes in skin that lead to increased smoothness and improved suppleness. Equally impressive, research shows soy isoflavones have the potential to help fade stubborn discolorations, whether from sun exposure or other sources. They help to reduce transfer of excess melanin to skin’s surface, thereby visibly reducing hyperpigmentation. Genistein is the predominant isoflavone in soy, and topically it’s been shown to intercept certain harmful effects of skin exposed to UV light. It also helps skin maintain better tensile strength (think elasticity). Daidzein and equol are other research-backed soy isoflavones for skin, each with unique and overlapping benefits. *Phytoestrogens are naturally occurring substances that are extracted from plants. At Paula’s Choice we continually analyze vast amounts of research to determine the most suitable ingredients to be used at safe levels in our products to deliver meaningful cosmetic benefits to the skin."

Antioxidants compounds such as flavonoids and phenolic acids are believed to be the key contributors to this benefit. Spiraea ulmaria is also a natural source of salicylates such as salicin, and it is sometimes claimed to be a natural source of the exfoliating ingredient salicylic acid. However, this comparison doesn’t hold up because the salicylates require a digestive system to convert to salicylic acid (this process doesn’t happen on skin). On the plus side, these compounds share salicylic acid’s skin-soothing benefits, so there’s benefit in that regard. This yellow-to-amber-colored plant extract seems to inhibit an enzyme in skin (5-alpha reductase) that can trigger excess oil production. Therefore, it’s likely that meadowsweet will have a noticeable positive effect for those struggling with oily skin. Standard usage levels of this ingredient aren’t firmly defined; however, amounts between 0.5–1% are necessary for helping control signs of oily skin.

Squalane,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Emollient, Antioxidant",Helps prevent moisture loss | Restores suppleness to skin | Helps strengthen skin’s barrier | Lightweight and non-greasy,"Squalane is an emollient that helps prevent moisture loss and restores suppleness to skin. It is also a source of beneficial fatty acids that replenish skin. One unique aspect of squalane is that it’s a modified, stable form of squalene, one of the key components in our sebum (oil). This makes squalane a biocompatible ingredient that skin instantly recognizes and knows how to use. Most skin care brands use a plant-derived source of squalane such as olive, wheat bran, rice bran, and amaranth oils. It can also be produced from Saccharomyces cerevisae (a type of yeast) or animal-derived, but this not the source Paula’s Choice Skincare uses. Despite its sebum-like nature, squalane feels surprisingly lightweight and non-greasy. Squalane can also help strengthen skin’s barrier to help it be less prone to sensitivity and reactiveness. Beyond its moisturizing properties, squalane also functions as an antioxidant. The antioxidant benefit of squalane also helps it protect skin’s oil from what’s known as lipid peroxidation, a process that damages skin’s surface and deeper in the pore lining where oil originates. This peroxidation is also believed to play a role in acne. Note that because it’s highly saturated, squalane is less prone to breaking down in the presence of air than less-saturated squalene. That said, it’s always wise to choose packaging that limits contamination issues (i.e. pump bottles as opposed to jars.) Squalane has been in use as a cosmetic ingredient for decades and has a long track record of safety. In 2019, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel determined squalane continues to be a safe ingredient. Their report looked a maximum concentration use at 96.8%). There is also data indicating safety at 100%. Usage levels in skin care vary depending on desired aesthetics and other emollients present."

Sunflower Seed Oil,Best,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Emollient, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant","A non-volatile, non-fragrant plant oil derived from sunflower seeds | Used as an emollient in cosmetics | Due to its high linoleic acid content, it can help replenish, strengthen and soothe skin | Great at reducing signs of skin stress or irritation","Sunflower seed oil is a non-volatile, non-fragrant plant oil used as an emollient in cosmetics. It’s also known as Helianthus annuus (Sunflower) seed oil. Sunflower seed oil’s 60% (on average) linoleic acid content has the ability to help replenish, strengthen, and soothe skin. This oil also contains other beneficial fatty acids skin can use, including oleic, palmitic, stearic and a small amount of omega-3 linolenic acid. Sunflower oil is particularly beneficial for dry, dehydrated, or environmentally compromised skin because its linoleic acid content helps skin synthesize its own lipids (fats), including ceramides, visibly repairing its barrier and leading to smoother, healthier-looking skin. Sunflower seed oil also has a natural calming effect on skin, so can be helpful for reducing signs of skin stress or irritation. In fact, research on infants with atopic dermatitis has shown that topical sunflower oil is a viable ingredient to alternate with topical steroids normally prescribed to control symptoms of this skin disorder."

The result is skin that appears plumper, firmer, and has restored elasticity (in some cases, in as little as one month of twice daily use at a concentration of 2.5%). The value in using a complex of peptides comes in how these peptides interact with each other. For example, one of the key peptides in this blend is palmitoyl dipeptide-5 diaminobutyroyl hydroxythreonine. Research indicates that its impressive ability to help support specific collagens and proteins found in skin’s dermal-epidermal junction comes in part from the synergy it has with supporting peptides that boosts its results – another case of the “better together” approach when it comes to some skin care ingredients."

It is one of the chief acids in wine. Tartaric acid has antioxidant properties and is an alpha hydroxy acid (AHA), though it is not quite as well-researched when it comes to skin benefits as glycolic and lactic acids. It functions best in helping to maintain the pH range that other AHAs need to work their magic. In certain formulas, it helps provide more targeted exfoliation, as each type of AHA has its layer-by-layer benefits owing to its molecular size. Interestingly, in vitro studies have shown that when tartaric acid is broken down into derivatives known as tartramides, its chemical structure mimics that of skin’s own ceramides. In a lab setting, these tartramides were shown to successfully replace ceramides in a model of skin’s lipid matrix; however, it’s unknown if this benefit also occurs on intact skin via cosmetic products. Tartaric acid has been deemed safe as used in cosmetics."

One of its functions is to help the body maintain homeostasis, the state of balance among all internal systems the body needs to work correctly. Studies point to a decline in taurine content over time as a contributing factor to the development of wrinkles and water loss in skin. Research also shows that because of taurine’s antioxidant abilities, topical application can help restore skin’s youthful appearance by improving the look of wrinkles. It can also help restore skin’s vital moisture barrier. Usage levels of taurine in skin care range from 0.1–1%. It is supplied as a white powder.

Some of this extract’s notable compounds include gallic acid, ascorbic acid (vitamin C), α-tocopherol (vitamin E), and lutein. Of these, kakadu plum’s vitamin C is often highlighted for its potency and potential skin-brightening effects. Researchers point out the oxygen radical-=TDF absorbance capacity (ORAC) rating for kakadu plum is extremely high, indicating it provides strong defense for skin against environmental stressors. A 2021 study (conducted on mice) suggested Terminalia ferdinandiana may also play a role in preserving skin’s collagen levels. In a completely different capacity, Terminalia ferdinandiana extract has been studied for its ability to minimize body odor due to its inhibitory effect on certain microorganisms. Suppliers of Terminalia ferdinandiana (kakadu plum) extract recommend usage levels between 1-3%. As with other antioxidants, formula’s containing this ingredient should be packaged to in way that restricts air and light exposure as much as possible to maintain stability and efficacy. (Opaque pump bottles are a good example of suitable packaging; clear jars are not.) Fun fact: In addition to this extract’s common name of kakadu plum, it also goes by billy goat plum, gubinge, or salty plum.

This improves its ability to maintain surface hydration and helps to visibly restore a firmer appearance. Clinical studies from this ingredient’s supplier show that it helps improve the “biomechanical properties” of skin. This means ongoing use helps to improve skin’s ability to bounce back when stretched, something which naturally declines with age and is compounded by cumulative environmental damage. It was also shown to smooth rough texture and decrease wrinkle volume, although the latter benefit was also achieved with a placebo product. These studies were done on human skin and objectively measured over a period of 8 weeks. In vitro data indicate that this peptide helps support skin’s underlying elements, further contributing to the look and feel of firmer, smoother skin. This peptide is supplied as a liquid, with the peptide combined with magnesium chloride and glycerin or similar substances to enhance skin compatibility and improve penetration.

Enzymes within skin convert this form of vitamin C to pure vitamin C, ascorbic acid. Unlike pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid), tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is lipid (fat) soluble. As such, it can penetrate further into skin where it works with vitamin E (tocopherol) that’s naturally in your skin or in skin care products to target skin’s underlying support system via a different pathway than water-soluble ascorbic acid. Some researchers theorize that tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate has a greater affinity for skin because its fatty acid component helps aid penetration. It pairs well with other forms of vitamin C, vitamin E, green tea, and retinol for enhanced effectiveness and anti-aging benefits. Its oil-soluble nature lets it neutralize the types of free radicals that damage skin’s lipids such as ceramides and cholesterol. This is primarily how it works as an antioxidant, while the water-soluble ascorbic acid helps neutralize other types of free radicals before they get too far past skin’s surface. Concentration-wise, amounts of 0.1% have antioxidant benefit, and it is often used at this level and up to 2% for maintaining skin health plus visibly soothing environmentally distressed skin. If the goal is targeting hyperpigmentation, research shows amounts of 5% or greater are necessary for best results. It’s most effective when formulated at a pH of 6 or below and may be used with other discoloration-reducing ingredients such as niacinamide and licorice root where it’s been shown to deliver synergistic results. In fact, a 30% concentration of THD used with other discoloration-reducing ingredients was shown to improve stubborn hyperpigmentation and was even suitable for melasma-prone skin. Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate has a slightly oily feel and may be colorless to pale yellow in appearance, depending on the supplier. It can be used in water-based formulas but must be combined with silicones or oils for ideal bioavailability. Despite inherent stability, it’s not impervious to eventual degradation from ongoing exposure to light and strong sources of heat (above 113 degrees Fahrenheit/45 degrees Celsius). For this reason, we advise avoiding products with this ingredient packaged in jars or transparent materials. Tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate is considered safe as used in cosmetics in concentrations up to 30% even when used with retinol, a 10% concentration of ascorbic acid, and other bio-active ingredients."

This plant is native to India and has a long history of use in Ayurvedic medicine. The main antioxidants from turmeric are collectively known as curcuminoids, of which there are three that have been thoroughly researched. Although curcuminoids are found naturally in the root of the turmeric plant, synthetic forms tend to be used more often in skin care because their natural forms are a deep yellow color which tends to stain skin. Chemists have developed a nearly colorless form that is bio-identical to the curcuminoids found in turmeric, so you get all the benefits without the stain effect. Along with potent free radical-scavenging activity, tetrahydrobisdemethoxydiferuloylmethane and similarly named curcuminoids can visibly reduce irritation and help fade discolorations so skin takes on a more even appearance over time. The curcuminoids also have considerable research showing that topical use helps visibly repair sun-damaged skin (although as with any such ingredient, skin cannot go back to the point before the damage occurred). In essence, curcuminoids are proven to promote and help maintain healthy skin at any age. The curcuminoids, including tetrahydrobisdemethoxydiferuloylmethane, also play a role in skin’s hyaluronic acid content, aiding skin’s natural ability to maintain a smooth, hydrated surface. Usage levels in skin care are typically between 0.02–0.5% for antioxidant benefits, with stronger soothing benefits seen in concentrations between 0.5–1%. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics. Curcuminoid ingredients such as this must be carefully formulated due to instability with ongoing exposure to light and air. They are also not soluble in water, so they must be used with glycols, oils or oil-like ingredients to enhance availability on and within skin. Another option is for these ingredients to be encapsulated for sustained delivery to skin’s uppermost layers, which also improves their stability."

It can be lab-synthesized but also occurs naturally in green tea leaves and some types of edible mushrooms. Consumption of green tea has numerous studies supporting its benefits for overall health and vitality, and its theanine component is of strong worth for use in skin care, too. Its low molecular weight allows it to penetrate past skin’s surface, where it works within its epidermal layers to attract and hold water, thus maintaining skin’s hydration. It also works within skin’s uppermost layers to offset factors that lead to signs of inflammation. Theanine is used on its own in foods and caffeinated beverages to enhance flavor (it tastes of caramel which offsets the bitterness of caffeine).

Titanium Dioxide,Best,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters, Coloring Agent/Pigment, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent",Used as a pigment and sunscreen ingredient | Protects against both UVA and UVB rays | Gentle enough even for sensitive skin | Deemed safe as used in cosmetics products,"Titanium dioxide is an inert earth mineral used as a thickening, opacifying, and sunscreen ingredient in cosmetics. It protects skin from UVA and UVB radiation and is considered non-risky in terms of of skin sensitivity. Because it is gentle, titanium dioxide is a great sunscreen active for sensitive, redness-prone skin. It’s great for use around the eyes, as it is highly unlikely to cause stinging. There are two primary forms of titanium dioxide commercially available: anatase and rutile. The rutile form is typically used in sunscreens due to its superior ability to handle UV rays and stability in the presence of UV light. The anatase form is typically used in other types of products, such as paint. Another plus of the rutile form is that its UVA protection extends past 400 nanometers, which is the upper limit of UVA. Titanium dioxide is typically micronized and coated for use in cosmetics products. The micronizing makes this somewhat heavy-feeling ingredient easier to spread on skin, plus a bit more cosmetically elegant. Micronized titanium dioxide is much more stable and can provide better sun protection than non-micronized titanium dioxide. Micronized titanium dioxide doesn’t penetrate skin so there’s no need to be concerned about it getting into your body. Even when titanium dioxide nanoparticles are used, the molecular size of the substance used to coat the nanoparticles is large enough to prevent them from penetrating beyond the uppermost layers of skin. This means you’re getting the sun protection titanium dioxide provides with no risk of it causing harm to skin or your body. The coating process improves application, enhances sun protection, and prevents the titanium dioxide from interacting with other ingredients in the presence of sunlight, thus enhancing its stability. It not only makes this ingredient much more pleasant to use for sunscreen, but also improves efficacy and eliminates safety concerns. Common examples of ingredients used to coat titanium dioxide are alumina, dimethicone, silica, and trimethoxy capryl silane. Titanium dioxide as used in sunscreens is commonly modified with other ingredients to ensure efficacy and stability. Examples of what are known as surface modifier ingredients used for titanium dioxide include stearic acid, isostearic acid, polyhydroxystearic acid, and dimethicone/methicone copolymer. Some websites maintain titanium dioxide is inferior to zinc oxide, another mineral sunscreen ingredient whose core characteristics are similar to those of titanium dioxide. The reality is that titanium dioxide is a great broad-spectrum SPF ingredient and is widely used in all manner of sun-protection products. What gets confusing for some consumers is trying to decipher research that ranks sunscreen ingredients by a UV spectrum graph. By most standards, broad-spectrum coverage for sunscreen ingredients is defined as one that surpasses 360 nanometers (abbreviated as “nm” - how the sun’s rays are measured). Titanium dioxide exceeds this range of protection, but depending on whose research you read, it either performs as well as or slightly below zinc oxide. It’s true that titanium dioxide does not rank as high for UVA protection as zinc oxide, it ends up being a small difference (think about it like being 10 years old versus 10 years and 3 months old). This is not easily understood in terms of other factors affecting how sunscreen actives perform (such as the base formula), so many, including some dermatologists, assume that zinc oxide is superior to titanium dioxide for UVA protection. When carefully formulated, titanium dioxide provides excellent UVA protection. Its UVA protection peak is lower than that of zinc oxide, but both continue to provide protection throughout the UVA range for the same amount of time. Titanium dioxide comes in the form of a white powder and is sometimes used in cosmetics to adjust a color to a lighter shade. This is also why it can produce a white cast."

These four forms are d-alpha-tocopherol, d-alpha-tocopherol acetate, dl-alpha tocopherol, and dl-alpha tocopherol acetate. The “d” prefix indicates that the product was derived from natural sources, such as vegetable oils or wheat germ; whereas the “dl” prefix indicates that the vitamin was created from a synthetic base. Research has shown that natural forms of vitamin E are more effective than their synthetic counterparts, but both have antioxidant activity. You’ll most commonly find vitamin E listed as tocopherol or tocopheryl acetate on the ingredient list. Vitamin E is a naturally occurring component of healthy skin, and its second most prevalent antioxidant behind ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It offers significant antioxidant properties to help defend from pollution and other environmental stressors that would otherwise weaken skin, causing unwanted changes. In skin care formulas, vitamin E also works as a good supporting ingredient. For instance, in vitamin C products, vitamin E will donate a key electron that vitamin C (as ascorbic acid) needs to stabilize itself. Vitamin E also works well with other antioxidants such as rosemary, ferulic acid, and the amino acid taurine. Claims of using vitamin E to prevent scarring when skin is wounded haven’t yet been confirmed by published scientific research. Vitamin E (tocopherol) can visibly improve hyperpigmentation when used in a 1% concentration. Typically, lower amounts are used in skin care for antioxidant benefit and to help preserve the stability of delicate ingredients. Tocopherol as used in skin care is almost always supplied as an oil, since it is derived from sources like soy, rice bran, or flax oils, among others. It has a characteristic yellow to gold or even light brown color and subtle odor. However, depending on the supplier, tocopherol may also be clear (transparent) to pale yellow. It will oxidize and become darker in color from exposure to air and light."

As with other forms of vitamin E, tocopherol acetate—which may also be listed as tocopheryl acetate—also helps keep delicate ingredients in cosmetics stable for longer. Vitamin E is often paired with pure vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for this purpose. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has ruled all forms of vitamin E safe as used in cosmetics.

It is categorized as a skin-conditioning agent (think moisturizing) and antioxidant (think anti-aging). When compared to other vitamin E derivatives, tocopheryl linoleate was shown to be one of the top free radical scavengers (meaning it has a significant impact on reducing the negative effects environmental stressors have on skin). Thus, this is a good ingredient to see in skin care formulations. Tocopheryl linoleate is used in a wide variety of other personal care products including makeup and hair or nail care. In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reconfirmed tocopheryl linoleate’s status as a safe ingredient. Their report surveyed products using tocopheryl linoleate in concentrations between 0.0001-1%. It is sometimes used in very low amounts to help stabilize plant extracts and vitamins."

Topically applied, it works by interrupting at least two pathways in skin that if left unchecked can lead to discolorations (e.g. dark spots, brown/gray patches). It is even suitable for melasma-prone skin. Tranexamic acid also appears to work within skin’s surface layers to make it less susceptible to UV light exposure, which ultimately helps skin retain its youthful appearance (though of course, sunscreen is still necessary for adequate protection). Double-blind and comparative research has shown that topical tranexamic acid in amounts between 2-5% rivals the results of over-the-counter concentrations of hydroquinone, long considered the gold standard for fading skin discolorations. Comparative studies also indicate tranexamic acid has greater tolerability than hydroquinone. Studies show consistent application of tranexamic acid is safe, and with topical concentrations between 2-5%, results typically show after two to three months of consistent use. Research also shows tranexamic acid may help reduce certain types of sensitivity-induced redness in skin. Note: Because tranexamic acid is a water-soluble ingredient, it works best in skin care products with oil-soluble ingredients (such as tocopherol or plant oils) designed to improve its penetration into skin. A new derivative of tranexamic acid known as cetyl tranexamate mesylate also shows promise for a reducing dark spots and redness. However, more research is needed before this can be assessed as thoroughly as tranexamic acid. It’s worth mentioning that tranexamic acid is sometimes prescribed for oral use in low doses to manage signs of melasma."

It has clinically proven wrinkle-smoothing action that produces visible results within 15 minutes of application. Over time, its line-smoothing benefits continue, leading to less visible wrinkles, including around the eyes and mouth. This targeted signal peptide works by influencing acetylcholine receptors within skin’s uppermost layers, helping to interrupt the process that leads to the appearance of expression lines. It also helps improve rough texture after four weeks of twice-daily use. Recommended usage levels of tridecapeptide-1 range from 1–10% in leave-on skin care products. Clinical data from the supplier has shown this ingredient’s efficacy is improved when paired with glycols used between 2–5%. Note: This ingredient’s name is one that’s known to be misused by disingenuous third-party suppliers looking to get their product into the marketplace sooner. Since Paula’s Choice uses this ingredient, we want to assure you that we’re purchasing direct from the originator of this peptide. Its ingredient name reflects the 13 amino acids present in the sequence, and the “-1” suffix simply differentiates it as the first International Nomenclature Cosmetic Ingredient (INCI) system registration of this name. The “=1” designation does not correlate to the amino acid sequence."
Triethyl Citrate,Best,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Solvent, Suspending/Dispersing Agent, Texture Enhancer",Solvent and texture-enhancing agent | Studied in conjunction with ethyl linoleate + actives where it was shown to improve efficacy | Positively effects pores and keratolytic activity (suitable for blemish-prone skin) | May also be used to enhance the dispersion of UV filters in sunscreen | Used by some deodorant manufacturer to inhibit components of sweat,"Triethyl citrate functions as a viscosity-increasing agent in cosmetic formulations and is sometimes used as a solvent in perfumes and other beauty products. It may also be used to enhance the dispersion of UV filters in sunscreen, critical for reaching the desired SPF level. Interestingly, triethyl citrate has been studied in conjunction with ethyl linoleate, azelaic acid, salicylic acid, and certain retinoids where it was shown to help improve the efficacy of each. These studies suggest that it has a positive effect on the microenvironment of pores and keratolytic activity. Likewise, research suggests triethyl citrate is suitable for blemish-prone skin and oil control. Suppliers of this ingredient also tout its use in deodorant where it is said to inhibit certain odiferous components of sweat. Technically speaking, triethyl citrate is the triester of ethyl alcohol and citric acid. As a raw material, it is supplied as a clear, colorless, oily liquid. According to the Personal Care Products Council, this ingredient can be sourced naturally through plants or synthetically created in the lab. The 2014 Cosmetic Ingredient Review safety report surveyed 244 personal care products containing triethyl citrate in 0.0008-6% concentrations. The expert panel analysis was that triethyl citrate is safe as used under these parameters. Further nodding to this ingredient’s safety, triethyl citrate earns GRAS (generally recognized as safe) status as a direct food additive by the United States Food and Drug Administration. Fun fact: Triethyl citrates is found naturally in cabbage and some white wines."

Turmeric,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant",,"Turmeric is a spice made from the dried, ground root of the Curcuma longa plant. It contains curcumin, a lipophilic, polyphenolic antioxidant pigment that gives turmeric its golden-yellow color. In addition to being a food seasoning, turmeric has numerous health benefits whether consumed orally vis foods and supplements or applied topically. Ongoing research has shown turmeric and the curcumin it contains play a safe and compelling role in promoting healthier, normalized skin. On skin, in vivo research has shown that turmeric and its derivatives interrupt signaling in surface cells that trigger signs of irritation. Turmeric helps calm skin and may even play a role in reducing the look of acne-related redness by modulating pathways to restore a healthier, more even appearance. Research has conclusively shown that turmeric is a potent antioxidant, largely due to its curcumin content (although turmeric also contains other antioxidants). Applying turmeric to skin can help offset signs of environmental damage and, to some extent, thwart the skin-damaging effects from UVB light. As with many antioxidants, turmeric requires protection from air and light, as routine exposure causes it to break down and limits its availability to skin. Beyond being an antioxidant, some research has shown the curcumin portion of turmeric boosts skin’s hyaluronic acid content, meaning turmeric can also be considered hydrating."
Ubiquinone,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant","Also known as coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10 | Occurs naturally in the body | Has antioxidant, skin-soothing, and anti-aging properties | Can impart a yellow color to skin care products","Ubiquinone is also (and perhaps more popularly) known as coenzyme Q10 or CoQ10. It is a vitamin-like, fat-soluble substance naturally present in the body. It is found primarily in the mitochondria and participates in cellular respiration which generates energy for the cell in the form of ATP (adenosine triphosphate). Applied to skin, it can have antioxidant benefits due to its energizing effect on factors in skin that tend to slow down with age and cumulative sun exposure. Ubiquinone content within skin is known to peak in early childhood and decline with age. There are also studies showing that environmental factors deplete the presence of ubiquinone in the skin. Topical application has been shown to have skin-soothing effects and recent research suggests its inclusion in skin care products can have a noticeable impact on the visible signs of aging. Since ubiquinone is a large molecule, it is not known to penetrate past the uppermost layers of skin; however, this is what’s believed to help make it so effective in its role of thwarting visible effects of environmental damage. Its effective usage level in skin is typically between 0.02-0.05%. Amounts of 1% or more tend to impart a strong yellow color to skin care formulas, as its natural color ranges from orange to dark red. It is considered non-irritating as used in cosmetics."
Undaria Pinnatifida (Algae) Extract,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts, Texture Enhancer",,"Undaria pinnatifida , also known as brown algae, is a type of seaweed that’s also edible. As with most seaweeds, it’s a rich source of nutrients, and those benefit skin when applied topically. Among the benefits from applying brown algae to skin are antioxidant from its polyphenols, hydration from its polysaccharides, and soothing, thanks to a compound known as fucoidan. In vitro (test tube) research has shown this type of algae plays a disruptive role in the pathway melanin (skin pigment) takes to make it to skin’s surface. In theory, topical use may keep discolorations at bay. Some research indicates brown algae has more antioxidants than red or green algae, but topically, all of them can thwart the cascade of damage common airborne pollutants can trigger on skin."

Topical use can play an important role in helping to shore up skin’s barrier and reduce several triggers of dry skin. Although also a component of urine, synthetic versions are used in cosmetics. In amounts between 3–5%, urea has beneficial water-binding properties proven to moisturize and soften skin. Amounts of 10% or more have mild to significant exfoliating properties proven to reduce dry, scaly skin and help prevent water loss. Larger concentrations (such as 40%) of urea can cause sensitivity, though such large amounts can also thoroughly exfoliate skin and have also been shown to markedly reduce severe dryness and rough, thickened texture. Higher amounts of urea are sometimes combined with salicylic acid in products meant for spot use on callused feet. Urea can enhance the absorption of other cosmetic ingredients such as retinoids. It can also impact the pH of water-based solutions, so is sometimes use to help stabilize a formula’s ideal pH range. Note that high concentrations of urea aren’t the most aesthetically pleasing, potentially being difficult to spread and leaving a notably tacky finish, not to mention an unpleasant, ammonia-like odor. On the other hand, the odor isn’t likely to be much of an issue if you’re applying to lower extremities instead of your face or neck. Its long history of use in dermatology and scientific reviews over the years have consistently shown urea to be safe and generally well tolerated as used in skin care."

Blueberry contains several types of antioxidants (known as polyphenolics) that are not only healthy for your body when eaten but also for your skin when applied via skincare products. Along with polyphenol antioxidants, blueberries are also a good source of vitamin C, although the polyphenol-based antioxidants are present in far greater amounts. Research has shown that the antioxidants in blueberries are particularly adept at shielding skin from the unwanted changes in skin that occur when it’s exposed to visible and infrared light. Essentially, the blueberries work to intercept damage before it takes hold, leading to healthier-looking skin. Just to be clear, though, blueberries do not replace a broad-spectrum sunscreen; rather, their benefits complement what sunscreen does to protect skin."

Vitamin A,Best,"Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Pore Minimizer","Anti-Aging, Anti-Acne, Pore Minimizer, Antioxidant","Also known as retinol | Has more than 70 years of research proving its anti-aging abilities | Communicates with skin, telling it how to look and behave younger | Effective at several strengths | Is sensitive to light and air exposure","Retinol is the name for the entire vitamin A molecule. This powerhouse ingredient has more than 70 years of established studies showing it has value for skin on several fronts: It’s a skin-restoring, wrinkle-smoothing, firming and pore-refining ingredient and an antioxidant, allowing it to improve a variety of skin concerns, most related to visible signs of aging. Retinol delivers its long list of visible results because of the way it uniquely communicates with skin cells and influences various pathways, effectively “telling” skin how to look and act younger. For instance, recent research shows retinol can jump-start skin’s production of hyaluronic acid, resulting in a plumper, more hydrated appearance. Packaging is a key issue, so any container that lets in air (like jar packaging) or sunlight (clear containers) just won’t cut it. Lots of retinol products come in unacceptable packaging; these should be avoided because the retinol will most likely be (or quickly become) ineffective. Only purchase retinol products sold in opaque, airless, or air-restrictive packaging. Many consumers are concerned about the percentage of retinol in anti-aging products such as serums or moisturizers. Although the percentage can make a difference (larger amounts of retinol, generally considered 3% or higher, are used in clinical settings for more dramatic results), it’s not helpful in understanding how a retinol product will benefit your skin. Studies have shown even small amounts (as low as 0.01%) of retinol can make an impact in the appearance of visible signs of aging. Far more important is the delivery system, packaging, and the other ingredients present with the retinol. Using a product with a range of anti-aging ingredients plus retinol is far more valuable for skin than using a product with only a supposedly high percentage of retinol. Skin needs far more than any one ingredient can provide, however great that one ingredient may be. There are several myths about using retinol with other anti-aging ingredients or products, such as those with vitamin C or exfoliants like glycolic acid."

It is best known for its ability to help visibly reduce enlarged pores and improve uneven/dull skin tone. It also strengthens a weakened skin barrier. An advantage of vitamin B3’s antioxidant power is that it can help visibly repair damage from UV light while offsetting other sources of environmental attack (including the negative impact of airborne pollutants). Another helpful benefit is that vitamin B3 helps fortify skin’s surface against moisture loss and dehydration by boosting its natural production of skin-strengthening ceramides. Studies have also shown vitamin B3 has a positive effect on reducing wrinkle depth. Unlike many superstar anti-aging ingredients, vitamin B3 is stable in the presence of heat and light. It is water soluble and presents as colorless needles or white crystalline powder in its raw material state. Vitamin B3 offers benefits for skin starting in concentrations as low 0.2%, and the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded it is safe in concentrations all the way up to 20%. Myths about vitamin B3’s incompatibility with other “bio-active” ingredients have been dispelled, and in fact, research overwhelmingly shows complementary effects of combining vitamin B3 with other key anti-aging ingredients."

Vitamin C,Best,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Dark Spot Fading","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Dark Spot Fading, Antioxidant",,"Vitamin C is one of the most well-researched and beneficial vitamins you can apply topically. Ongoing use has been shown to improve the look of multiple signs of aging, brighten an uneven skin tone, as well as provide skin-restoring and soothing benefits. Vitamin C comes in many forms, with ascorbic acid being the most well-researched for its efficacy. Other forms of vitamin C you will see included in skincare products include magnesium ascorbyl phosphate, L-ascorbic acid, tetrahexyldecyl ascorbate, ascorbyl palmitate, ascorbyl glucosamine, and ascorbyl tetraisopalmitate. In any form, vitamin C provides potent antioxidant protection, shielding skin from damaging environmental stressors. Note: All antioxidants, including vitamin C, are vulnerable to destabilizing when exposed to air and light. That means if you want to reap the reward of your antioxidant-enriched treatments, only choose those that are packaged in opaque tubes, air-restrictive bottles, or pumps that help keep their ingredients stable."
Vitamin E,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant",,"One of the most well-known and researched antioxidants for the body and for skin. Vitamin E occurs naturally in human skin, but can become depleted due to constant environmental exposure in the absence of sun protection. There are eight basic forms of the entire fat soluble vitamin E molecule, which are either synthetically or naturally derived. The most typical forms are d-alpha-tocopherol, d-alpha-tocopherol acetate, dl-alpha tocopherol, and dl-alpha tocopherol acetate. The “d” prefix in front of the “alpha” indicates that the product was derived from natural sources, such as vegetable oils or wheat germ; the “dl” prefix indicates that the vitamin was created from a synthetic base. Research has shown that natural forms of vitamin E are more effective than their synthetic counterparts, but both definitely have antioxidant activity. What about using pure vitamin E on scars? Although this is a popular tip, research has shown doing so isn’t effective and in some cases can actually make matters worse."

There is research showing that white and green teas have the highest concentration of antioxidant properties (via their polyphenol and flavonoid content) of all teas. However, even though tea flavonoids are effective antioxidants, it is unclear to what extent they increase the antioxidant capacity of humans. It appears that white and green teas have similar amounts of the polyphenol epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), which is the main antioxidant in tea. The conclusion is that white and green tea have nearly identical antioxidant activity, and both are great antixoidants to look for in skincare products."

It is also known for its soothing properties. Beneficial phytochemical constituents of Withania somnifera root extract include ascorbic, caffeic, and ferulic acids. Claims around this ingredient often extol its “adaptogenic” properties. The term “adaptogenic” refers to plants that can adapt to environmental changes in the wild. The theory is that they can do the same for skin, though there isn’t a lot of hard research proving that’s the case (your skin isn’t the biologic equivalent of a plant). Still, even if they don’t help skin adapt to changing external conditions, the antioxidant benefits have merit in a skin care product. In skin care, this ingredient is typically combined with glycerin, propanediol, or plant-derived sugars. Usage levels of this blend range from 0.5–2%. Withania somnifera root extract has a long history of use in Ayurvedic medicine, as well other traditional uses around the world. Key Points:"

In the plant world, xylitol naturally occurs in many fruits and vegetables, including mushrooms, lettuce, oats strawberries, bananas, and yellow plums. It can also be derived from wood or upcylced paper. Research has shown that, like the skin-replenishing ingredient glycerin and similar sugar-derived ingredient sorbitol, xylitol hydrates due to its humectant (moisture-binding) properties. Xylitol also has an influential role in normalizing skin and the natural process keratinocytes (skin cells) go through as they work their way from the lower to the upper layers to the surface. Part of this is due to its ability to squelch damaging factors in skin that would otherwise throw skin’s natural processes off track. Xylitol is considered a nutritive sweetener and when added to foods or foods that naturally contain xylitol are eaten, research has shown it has prebiotic action that positively influences the gut microbiome. Xylitol is a source of galactooligosaccharides, which are primary responsible for its prebiotic ability. When combined with other oligosaccharides such as those derived from fructose, xylitol helps keep the population of good and bad bacteria on skin’s surface balanced. Xylitol is considered safe as used in cosmetics. In the United States, it is freely permitted as a food additive and is often used as a sugar (sucrose) substitute since it digests slower, thus doesn’t raise blood sugar quickly. Usage levels typically go up to 10%, with much lower amounts used when this sugar is combined with other humectants and prebiotics."

Glycolipids known as glucosylceramides can be derived from yeast and have a role in improving skin’s barrier. The type of yeast used is usually the microorganism Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Several studies have shown its value as a soothing antioxidant for skin. Torula yeast may also be used as the source for yeast extract in cosmetics. Yeast extract is also a probiotic. Studies have shown that its influence on skin’s microbiome is largely how it works to soothe skin. In essence, it helps skin’s microbiome become healthier which in turn reduces signs of sensitivity. Bioferments of yeast strains derived from soy isoflavones daidzein and genistein plus a plant-derived compounds known as apigenin were shown in vitro to interrupt a pathway that leads to the appearance of hyperpigmentation. Its usage levels in skin care range from 1–5% in rinse-off formulas and 0.045%–7% in leave-on formulations. Yeast extract is considered safe as used in cosmetics. Ongoing research is exploring the usefulness of yeast extract in the medical arena, such as experimental vaccines to prevent skin cancers."

Zinc Oxide,Best,"Anti-Aging, Soothing, Oil Control","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Oil Control, UV Filters, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Absorbent",Broad spectrum mineral UV filter | Proven gentle enough for sensitive skin | Serves multiple functions in cosmetics,"Zinc oxide is an inert earth mineral used as a thickening, lubricating, and sunscreen active ingredient in cosmetics. Along with titanium dioxide (another mineral sunscreen active ingredient), zinc oxide is considered to have no risk of skin sensitization. Zinc oxide is so gentle and non-irritating that it’s used as a skin protectant, particularly in diaper rash creams for infants. As a sunscreen ingredient, it is effective in providing protection against sun’s UVA rays in addition to UVB rays. In fact, zinc oxide is the broadest spectrum UVA and UVB reflectors approved for use as a sunscreen by the United States Food and Drug Administration and is allowed in sunscreens in concentrations up to 25%. As a skin protectant, its maximum usage level is also 25%. Zinc oxide is also sometimes used in makeup to impart opacity to products like foundations, particularly powder-based makeup. In recent years, there have been concerns about the use of nano-sized zinc oxide in sunscreen formulations. Nanotechnology is about taking a material and making it much smaller than its original size. In the case of zinc oxide, nanotechnology is used to make it more aesthetically pleasing, as well as enhance its SPF. Nano-sized zinc oxide is not believed to be a safety concern for skin; a study published in Investigative Dermatology found that zinc oxide nanoparticles don’t penetrate the skin or damage it on a cellular level - even with repeated applications. Additional studies have found that nanosized zinc oxide is non-irritating in a manner similar to non-nano zinc oxide."

It’s created when one of the amine hydrogens within methionine’s structure is exchanged for an acetyl group. In an acetyl group, one part of a molecule is replaced with another, in this case a blend of three hydrogen, two carbon, and one oxygen molecule. This changes how the whole molecule works, in this case for the better! Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and are critical to health. When used in skin care, amino acids serve as humectants, helping the skin to retain moisture. Some amino acids, including methionine and acetyl methionine, are also antioxidants, helping skin to mitigate damage brought on by environmental stressors, like the sun and pollution. Their ability to help the skin hold on to moisture and their knack for helping to protect skin from environmental stressors also makes them notable anti-aging agents.

Aluminum,Good,,,,"Aluminum is the most common element on Earth. It’s also a common source of confusion in terms of its presence in cosmetics, specifically whether that presence poses a health risk. The fact is, when you read “aluminum” on an ingredient list, it isn’t pure aluminum— not even close. Pure aluminum is not added to any skincare or makeup product. Rather, compounds (mixtures of aluminum), such as aluminum combined with other natural elements, are safety used in a variety of ways in personal care products, foods and medicines. These compounds contain only traces of aluminum, and in daily use over the long term are perfectly safe. Such ingredients actually contain less aluminum than what occurs naturally in plants, vegetables or even in the human body). Here are a few examples of the most common aluminum compounds used as ingredients in cosmetics, and a brief description of what they are (as well as their global safety status). 1. Aluminum chlorohydrate and aluminum chloride contain only trace quantities of pure aluminum. These are most commonly used in antiperspirant and deodorants (and some medications) with extensive safety records. 2. Alumina is also not “aluminum,” but rather a combination of minerals that contain various mixtures of aluminum, silica, chloride or zirconium and oxygen. It is also known as “aluminum oxide” or “aluminum hydroxide,” and is used safely in cosmetics, medicines and medical devices. 3. Magnesium aluminum silicate is refined from clay and often used as an absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It is unable to penetrate skin. 4. Aluminum starch is made from a reaction of a plant-derived ingredient (starch), and often used as a thickening or absorbent ingredient in cosmetics. It has an extensive safety record. In cosmetics, the minute quantities of aluminum present in such ingredients are not at risk of absorption, as it these ingredients are insoluble—they are physically incapable of absorption into the body. This is true of such ingredients, whether they are used in cosmetics or skincare/personal care products. In fact, skin does not readily absorb cosmetic ingredients. It’s actually quite challenging to penetrate the skin’s outer layers with skincare or medical products- such formulas must be specifically engineered to allow ingredients to penetrate even the most superficial layer of skin. Thus, aluminum or aluminum ingredients do not contribute to health risks, and a link otherwise has not been established. Quite the opposite, as the Mayo Clinic, The World Health Organization, the European Union and the FDA have all concurred that there is no linkage of aluminum in personal care products to other health risks. Published literature and an overwhelming amount of research has shown that skin cannot absorb aluminum from these ingredients, and what is used is far less than what we are exposed to daily in the food and water (given aluminum is a natural element that’s present all around us—whether we use products with aluminum ingredients or not)."
Aluminum Hydroxide,Good,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Texture Enhancer, Absorbent","Found naturally in certain minerals | Opacifying agent, skin protectant, and absorbent | Ruled safe as used in cosmetics | Also used as an antacid","Aluminum hydroxide is an inorganic material found naturally in the minerals bauxite and gibbsite. In medical settings it serves as an antacid (and is available over the counter in a number of antacid formulations). In cosmetics, aluminum hydroxide is quite versatile: it’s employed as an opacifying agent, skin protectant, texture enhancer and absorbent. It also functions as a coloring agent, but perhaps its most important role is a coating agent for mineral UV filters such as titanium dioxide. In this role, it helps prevent the breakdown of titanium dioxide, preventing the formation of free radicals on skin. Note: In some sunscreens with mineral filters, the aluminum hydroxide derivative alumina is used. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review has ruled aluminum hydroxide safe in its current use in cosmetics."

It is considered safe as currently used in amounts of 2% or less in cosmetic formulas. Aminomethyl propanol can penetrate skin’s uppermost layers, but does not go further, meaning it does not get into the body. It is believed to aid the penetration of other skin care ingredients which in some circumstances (such as exfoliating acids) can make them more effective while at the same time keeping their efficacious pH range stable. Aminomethyl propanol can be found in all kinds of beauty products from serums and lotions to hair care formulations and dyes, and so on."

Specifically, it is a combination of l-ascorbic acid (pure vitamin C) and 3-aminopropyl dehydrogen phosphate, a molecule purported to enhance the stability of the l-ascorbic acid. Like most forms of vitamin C, aminopropyl ascorbyl phosphate has value for its antioxidant properties (specifically for its ability to scavenge free radicals) as well as its ability to help mitigate the visible effects of sun damage. Extensive studies have not been done yet on the safety of this form of vitamin C as used in cosmetics, though the form of vitamin C it is derived from is considered safe. Usage levels of aminopropyl ascorbyl phosphate range from 0.1–1%. Unlike pure vitamin C, the pH range for this derivative is much broader, giving it greater formulary flexibility."

There’s some research showing mandelic acid is an effective exfoliant, although it’s not as effective as glycolic acid due to its larger size (it’s twice as big as glycolic acid) and slower penetration into skin; however, these traits can also make mandelic acid more tolerable for those with sensitive skin. Unlike glycolic acid, mandelic acid is light-sensitive and must be packaged in an opaque container to remain effective. It may be synthetic or derived from almonds. Like other AHAs, mandelic acid is most effective in leave-on products that are within a 3-4 pH range. A couple studies have shown that mandelic acid and salicylic acid worked well together in a higher-strength peel for use on darker skin tones struggling with discolorations, including post-acne marks. However, what we don’t know is how well mandelic acid would’ve worked on its own - it’s possible the results were more from salicylic acid than the combination of the two acids. Other research has shown mandelic acid can increase sebum (oil) production, which isn’t great for oily skin but would be a benefit for dry skin."
Amylopectin,Good,,Texture Enhancer,"A polysaccharide commonly known as starch | Adds bulk, binds and helps improve texture of cosmetics | Derived from common foods such as bananas and potatoes | Considered safe for topical use","Amylopectin is a water-insoluble polysaccharide starch whose high molecular weight doesn’t penetrate skin. Its main purpose when used in cosmetics is to control the viscosity (thickness) of products via its binding properties. This contributes to the product’s texture and flow. In cosmetics, amylopectin may be supplied as a gel, liquid, or as granules. This starch, which is also a natural polymer, is derived from unripe fruit (bananas are a common source), tubers (potatoes) and cereal grains like wheat and barley. It makes up between 70–80% of what’s considered common starch, the latter being the polysaccharide amylose, which is the type of starch that can crystallize. Amylopectin is considered safe as used in cosmetics, with no concentration restrictions pertaining to its use."

It’s also known as urucum, which translates to “red”. The intensely-hued orange-red powder derived from the seeds isn’t just used as a natural colorant in cosmetics—it’s also used in foods (it’s how paprika gets its bright color and what makes butter yellow), paints, and textiles throughout the world. Fun fact: 70% of the natural colorants used in foods are derived from annatto! It’s considered safe, non-toxic and isn’t known to irritate skin. Research has shown annatto’s use in food may play a protective role in the prevention of food-borne illness. The color of annatto comes from a carotenoid compound known as bixin. Along with this antioxidant compound are others that can benefit skin, including isobixin, beta-carotene, cryptoxanthin, lutein, zeaxanthin, ellagic acid, and the amino acids threonine, tryptophan, and phenylalanine. The United States Food & Drug Administration has deemed annatto safe as used in cosmetics, including in products meant for use on lips and around the eyes. Concentrations vary based on desired color outcome and it’s been observed that the pH of a given water-based formula plays a role in the color’s outcome."

This extract comes from the cherimoya fruit (AKA custard apple), a product of the Anona cherimola plant that thrives in tropical and subtropical climates. Studies reveal that Annona cherimola fruit extract contains a plethora of phenolic compounds (like lutein, rutin, catechin and vanillic acid) as well as vitamins (vitamin A and C). Phenolic compounds and vitamins both function as antioxidants, a group of diverse compounds that defend skin from pro-aging environmental damage. Research also suggests this plant extract can contribute to soothing and helps curb the growth of unwanted microorganisms that could negatively impact skin’s microbiome. There’s limited research on Annona cherimola fruit extract’s impact on skin. However, the current research on the extract itself is promising. Suppliers of this ingredient suggest usage levels ranging from 3% to 10% when part of a blend. Annona cherimola fruit extract has other applications in traditional medicine, plant care and the pharmaceutical industry, where it can be used against degenerative and chronic diseases when ingested.

Aqua/Water/Eau,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Solvent",The most widely used cosmetic ingredient | Functions as a solvent | Typically appears as the first ingredient in skin care products | Only a 10% concentration is needed in skin’s outer layers for softness and pliability,"Aqua/Water/Eau (also simply known as water) is the most frequently used cosmetic ingredient. Aqua/Water/Eau in skin care products is almost always listed first on an ingredient label because it is usually the ingredient with the highest concentration in the formula. Water’s primary function in skin care formulas is as a solvent. Despite claims of skin’s need for hydration and claims regarding special types of water, it turns out that water for skin may not be as an important ingredient as commonly thought. Only a 10% concentration of water in the outer layer of skin is necessary for softness and pliability in this part of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum. Studies that have compared the water content of dry skin with that of normal or oily skin do not find a statistically significant difference in moisture levels between them. Further, too much water can be a problem for skin because it can disrupt the essential substances in skin’s surface layers that keep it intact, smooth, and healthy-looking. As an example, recall how skin on your fingers and toes “prune” when you soak in the bathtub or other body of water for too long."

It is non-irritating as opposed to harsh, drying forms of alcohol. Arachidyl alcohol may also function as part of an emulsifying blend to help keep unlike ingredients (such as oil and water) from separating in a formula. Despite this benefit, it’s considered hydrophobic, meaning it’s nearly insoluble in water. This explains why it is often used as part of a blend with water-soluble emulsifiers. You can find this ingredient incorporated in all kinds of beauty products including facial moisturizers, body lotions, and anti-aging treatments. It is sometimes referred to as 1-Eicosanol. Concentration protocols haven’t been established for arachidyl alcohol, but it is not known to be a skin sensitizer in amounts commonly used in cosmetics."

It might be easy to confuse asiaticoside for the plant extract _Centella asiatica_’s other impactful compounds, madecassoside, asiatic acid and madecassic acid, however asiaticoside is its own substance. Research continually demonstrates asiaticoside’s soothing properties on skin, making it particularly suitable for sensitive skin types, as well as even being suitable for skin prone to eczema or rosacea. Asiaticoside also assists skin in mitigating the damage that’s associated with external pro-aging aggressors, like UV rays and pollution. This additional defense helps keep skin appearing more youthful in the long-term, deterring the formation of wrinkles, fine lines and an uneven tone often associated with environmental damage. Further studies have suggested that asiaticoside might have a positive impact on skin firmness through helping to support skin’s underlying architectural structure, but more research needs to be conducted to confirm this conclusion. When used in skin care and cosmetics, asiaticoside’s usually included in formulas in amounts between 0.2% and 5%."

Aspartic Acid,Good,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Antioxidant",An amino acid that helps build collagen | Has light hydrating properties | Also works as a buffering agent in cosmetics | May be animal-derived or synthetic,"Aspartic acid is a non-essential amino acid, meaning the body doesn’t require it from dietary or supplement sources because it can make aspartic acid on its own. When it comes to skin care, aspartic acid is known to hydrate, help soothe, and strengthen skin’s environmental defenses. As with several other amino acids, aspartic acid plays a building block role in the formation of skin’s collagen and elastin. Studies have shown aspartic acid fragmentation in aged samples of human elastin, showing its degradation weakens skin’s support. It’s important to note that topical application of aspartic acid hasn’t been shown to impact collagen or elastin. Our goal here is explaining how this amino acid contributes to skin’s support. Aspartic acid also plays a role as a buffering agent in cosmetics, helping to establish and hold a product’s pH. On its own, usage levels in cosmetics range between 1–6.5%. Lesser amounts are used when aspartic acid is part of a blend with other amino acids and skin-conditioning ingredients. Its safety for skin has been evaluated and confirmed."

It functions as an emollient ingredient that works to keep moisture in skin and soften its texture. More commonly known as murumuru butter, it is a species of Brazilian palm tree and its benefits are considered similar to palm oil."
Atelocollagen,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",Usually derived from cow skin | Injected in clinical settings to heal ligaments | Also used via injection as an ingredient delivery vector | Works topically as a humectant,"Atelocollagen is a purified collagen derivative usually extracted from bovine (cow) skin. Applied topically, atelocollagen – like regular collagen – has humectant properties that result in smoother, more supple skin and a visible reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. It does not, however, build new collagen or restore collagen production that has depleted over time (however, there are other ingredients that can do that!). This type of collagen is a polymer that has had certain peptides removed from each end to make it more tolerable for the purpose of injections. In clinical settings, this collagen has been directly injected into patients to assist the healing of torn ligaments. It is also used as a vector to deliver other ingredients via injection with minimal risk of rejection. Use levels of atelocollagen in skin care range from 1–5%, where it is typically supplied as a blend with other ingredients such as collagens, vitamins and/or plant extracts."
Barium Sulfate,Good,,"Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Coloring Agent/Pigment, Texture Enhancer","Works to opacify products, such as creams and lotions | May help boost skin barrier recovery | Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed safe for use in cosmetics","Barium sulfate is an inorganic salt that occurs in nature. As a cosmetic ingredient, the synthetic form is used so as to avoid sulfuric acid impurities that can irritate skin. It works to opacify products, such as creams and lotions but is used extensively in non-aqueous makeup products such as lipsticks, blush, and mascaras, as it helps extend the longevity of cosmetic pigments, plus apply its own “coloration” similar to how titanium dioxide adds whiteness. Barium sulfate may play a role in skin barrier recovery by preventing water loss from skin’s uppermost layers. In 2018, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Board revisited the safety of barium sulfate as used in cosmetics, where amounts range from 0.99%-37% in either rinse-off or leave-on products. The Board determined barium sulfate is safe and non-sensitizing provided it’s formulated to be non-irritating (meaning the finished ingredient does not contain irritating salts from sulfuric acid). As the synthetic form of barium sulfate is what’s available for use in cosmetics, there is, quite literally, no need to be concerned that it might irritate skin; however, as with any cosmetic ingredient, an individual allergic reaction could still occur (although this is considered rare)."
Barley Extract,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Extract from barley plants. Can have antioxidant properties when ingested, but there is no research showing this to be the case when applied topically. Barley and its extracts/derivatives are a source of gluten. When fermented (as it is when used to make beer or when combined with yeast in cosmetics), barley extract has been shown to soothe skin."

Behenic Acid,Good,,"Texture Enhancer, Cleansing Agent",A saturated fatty acid primarily used as a thickener and opacifying agent | Sometimes used as a replacement for the lighter-weight ingredient stearic acid | Works with traditional cleansing agents as a co-surfactant | Considered safe as used in rinse-off and leave-on cosmetics,"Behenic acid is a fatty acid that is used as a thickener, cleansing agent, and opacifier in cosmetics. Also known as docosanoic acid, this ingredient may be plant-derived or synthetic. It’s a major component of moringa oil and is also found in peanut oil. The saturated nature of this long-chain (more than 20 carbon molecules) wax-like fatty acid is what gives it opacifying and texture-enhancing properties. It is sometimes used as an alternative to stearic acid, a decision dependent on desired aesthetics. Despite this being a saturated fatty acid, its lower molecular weight and affinity for skin enable it to enhance the penetration of other ingredients without posing a risk of irritation. Although also categorized as a surfactant (cleansing agent) behenic acid is typically used with pure surfactants to create fatty acid-enhanced oil-gel textures that can capably yet gently remove excess oil and long-wearing, more tenacious ingredients. Usage levels of behenic acid in cosmetics range from 0.024–22%. Products like lipstick that may lead to incidental ingestion may contain up to 14% behenic acid. All of these amounts are considered safe for skin."

It is noted in research as being “skin friendly” because it does not impair intercellular lipids. It is especially popular in hair care formulations geared for curly textures where it serves as a conditioning agent to keep hair static-free, moisturized, and less prone to frizzing. Behentrimonium methosulfate is also noted for its ability to enhance the delivery of actives to skin. Behentrimonium methosulfate is categorized as quaternary ammonium salt (water-soluble positively charged ions). As a raw material, it takes the form of pale-yellow pellets. This ingredient is noted for compatible stability over a wide pH range. In 2012, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed behentrimonium methosulfate safe as used in personal care products. Their report looked at products containing up to 10% concentration, though typically usage levels are much lower (around 0.5%-2%)."
Behenyl Alcohol,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Texture Enhancer, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer","Is considered a fatty, non-drying form of alcohol | Is used as a thickener and moisturizing ingredient in cosmetics | Also known as 1-docosanol | Has been ruled safe as used in cosmetics","Behenyl alcohol, also known as 1-docosanol, is a synthetic or plant-derived thickening agent and emulsifier used in cosmetics.

While its absorbent properties are helpful for those with oily skin, it can be drying for other skin types (especially when used in very high amounts). To overcome this, some formulators pair bentonite with hydrating/soothing ingredients. These work to limit the absorbency of bentonite while still allowing skin to benefit without becoming dried out. Other reported functions of bentonite in cosmetics include bulking agent/thickener, emulsion stabilizer, opacifying agent, and suspending agent. Raw bentonite is derived from the alteration of volcanic ash and is mainly composed of the minerals montmorillonite and illite. It undergoes a purification process before being sold as a cosmetic ingredient and has a long history of safe use. Further backing bentonite’s safety, it is generally recognized as safe (also known as GRAS status) by the US FDA as a direct food additive."
Benzoic Acid,Good,,"Preservative, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer","Recognized as a safe, well-tolerated preservative, effective against yeast and mold | Also functions as a pH adjuster in skin care formulations | Naturally aromatic but usually isn’t used in high enough potency to impart scent in skin care | Needs to be used in combination with other preservatives for optimum protection","Benzoic acid functions as a preservative and pH adjuster in skin care formulations. It is known to be well tolerated and unlikely to cause sensitization in amounts commonly used. It should be combined with other preservatives in order to prevent broader contamination, particularly in water-based formulas. Benzoic acid primarily serves to reduce growth of fungi, such as yeast or mold. It is not considered very active against bacteria. When used as a preservative, it is strongly suggested that the pH of the final formulation be below six for maximum efficacy. In 2017, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel looked at personal care products using up to 5% benzoic acid and ruled that this ingredient is safe in cosmetic use. When used as a preservative in skin care products, you’ll find benzoic acid in much lower concentrations, usually between 0.2–0.5%. Note: While benzoic acid can be aromatic in nature, it usually isn’t used in high enough potency to deliver a detectable scent in skin care products. Fun fact: Benzoic acid is naturally found in fruits (berries), nuts, spices and vegetables. Rich sources include strawberries, cayenne pepper, mustard, prunes, cinnamon, and cloves. Benzoic acid is also added to food products as a preservative."

It also occurs naturally in skin and the body. It’s known as an osmolyte, an ingredient that helps skin adapt to moisture losses and gains, essentially working to balance skin’s hydration. Betaine is often included in cleansing blends because of its gentle soothing nature that helps offset the potential irritating effects of detergents. It’s also used as a hair conditioning ingredient. Newer research indicates betaine shows promise as a topical ingredient to visibly correct uneven skin tone. More studies are needed to confirm this effect, but so far, the results look encouraging. The 2018 Cosmetic Ingredient Review of betaine concluded that this ingredient is safe. Their report surveyed personal care products containing amounts up to 8.7%."
Betaine Salicylate,Good,Anti-Acne,"Anti-Acne, Exfoliant",,"Derived from sugar beets, this ingredient is sometimes used as an alternative to the exfoliating ingredient salicylic acid in countries where the usage of salicylic acid is prohibited or the amount permitted is severely restricted. Although betaine salicylate appears to be promising, there’s no independent research to go on, and no independent studies comparing its effectiveness to the well-established BHA ingredient salicylic acid. The only research about betaine salicylate comes from Arch Personal Care Products, an ingredient manufacturer that sells this ingredient. According to their information based on in vivo testing, betaine salicylate shows comparable effectiveness to salicylic acid at double the concentration. So, in seems that in order to get the same results from betaine salicylate as a product with 2% salicylic acid, a 4% concentration of betaine salicylate is necessary. Interestingly, like salicylic acid, betaine salicylate’s effectiveness is pH-dependent, with a pH range of 3.8-4.2 being needed. Anecdotal information from consumers who’ve tried products with betaine salicylate and salicylic acid is mixed; some people report better results and tolerability with betaine salicylate, while others report that salicylic acid worked better, without any unwanted effects. Our advice? Unless you know your skin cannot tolerate or doesn’t respond well to leave-on exfoliants with salicylic acid, there’s little reason to seek out an exfoliant with betaine salicylate. However, if you live in a country where salicylic acid’s use in skincare is unusually restricted, betaine salicylate exfoliants are worth checking out, but be sure the concentration is at least 4%."

BHT,Good,,"Antioxidant, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer",The abbreviation for butylated hydroxytoluene | Potent synthetic antioxidant | Helps keep delicate ingredients stable | Considered safe as used in cosmetics,"BHT is butylated hydroxytoluene, a potent synthetic antioxidant sometimes used to help stabilize light- and air-sensitive cosmetic ingredients such as retinol and unsaturated fatty acids. BHT is also globally approved for use as a food-grade preservative, where its antioxidant action keeps foods fresher longer. Amounts of 0.02% or less are considered safe for this use; however, controversial reports have been published since the 1970s that digestive metabolites of BHT could cause health problems. The amount of BHT uses in cosmetic products is typically 0.0002%-0.5%. Such low amounts do not pose a risk to skin (indeed, the safety assessment found BHT was non-irritating) nor does it penetrate skin far enough to be absorbed into the bloodstream. The European Union’s Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety concluded in December 2021 that “BHT is safe as an ingredient up to a maximum concentration of 0.8% in other leave-on and rinse-off products.”"
Bifida Ferment Filtrate,Good,,Prebiotic/Probiotic/Postbiotic,"Filtrate obtained through the fermentation of compound bifidobacterium strains | Typically found in skin care products claiming to deliver microbiome-balancing benefits | Currently, there is a lack of research on this ingredient as it pertains to skin | In raw material form, it appears as a colorless to light-yellow, transparent liquid","Bifida ferment filtrate is a non-living probiotic-related ingredient typically found in skin care products claiming to deliver microbiome-balancing benefits (although “supporting the microbiome” is more accurate since one ingredient cannot balance the ever-shifting microbiome). It is a filtrate obtained through the fermentation of compound bifidobacterium strains. At the time of this review, there is a lack of research on this ingredient as it pertains to skin, making it difficult to assess. In general, fermented probiotics have been shown to help reduce the proliferation of harmful microorganisms on skin’s surface. In theory, there’s potential for Bifida ferment filtrate to improve the health of skin. Suppliers of this ingredient claim that it offers mild exfoliating and antioxidant benefits. However, we did not find any independent studies to support this. Despite this, similar ingredients have impressive bona-fides, so we’re giving this one some leeway in anticipation of what future research may reveal. In raw material form, it appears as a colorless to light-yellow, transparent liquid. As this is a probiotic-related ingredient, it is best to keep it away from both light and air exposure."

It’s used in cosmetics for film-forming and texture-enhancing properties but also has humectant (water-binding) and soothing properties on skin. Along with improving texture, biosaccharide gum-1 can help reduce a sticky, tacky finish, replacing it with a smoother feel. It’s compatible within a broad pH range and “plays well” with countless ingredients, making it a versatile tool in a cosmetic chemist’s bag of tricks. The usage levels of biosaccharide gum-1 in cosmetics ranges from 0.5–8% when supplied as a gel (although 6% was the maximum reported used in this ingredient’s safety assessment). When supplied in concentrated powder form, lower amounts of 0.1–1% suffice. This ingredient is considered safe for use in cosmetics."

Commonly used in lip care products, it delivers intense hydration, a luxurious feel, and a glossy appearance. This ingredient’s ability to create a protective barrier on the skin helps lock in moisture and prolong the benefits of other skin care actives. Beyond lip care, bis-diglyceryl polyacyladipate-2 is also found in various skin care and hair care formulations due to its excellent spreadability, texture-enhancing qualities, and compatibility with other ingredients. Its vegan-friendly nature makes it a popular alternative to lanolin. As a raw material, bis-diglyceryl polyacyladipate-2 is described as a yellow, pasty, tacky, stringy substance that is practically insoluble in water. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel has concluded that bis-diglyceryl polyacyladipate-2 is safe for use in cosmetics.

In cosmetics, it serves multiple purposes, including skin conditioning agent, surfactant, foam booster, and moisturizer. Claims that silicones in any form cause or worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow “suffocate” skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are either myths or based on anecdotal evidence. Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use. These types of cosmetic silicones are effective, inert, and versatile ingredients that benefit skin and hair in numerous ways."

Broad Spectrum,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters",,"Term that refers to a sunscreen’s ability to protect the skin from both UVA and UVB rays from the sun. Current FDA regulations state that in order for any SPF-rated product to make a broad spectrum claim, it must pass what’s known as a critical wavelength test and have the required testing done to confirm its SPF rating is 15 or greater. Any SPF-rated product below SPF 15 can only make a broad spectrum claim that applies to sunburn prevention, not skin aging (wrinkles, brown spots) or skin cancer. The new labeling will also tell consumers on the back of the product that sunscreens labeled as both “Broad Spectrum” and “SPF 15” (or higher) not only protect against sunburn, but, if used as directed with other sun protection measures, can reduce the risk of skin cancer and early skin aging. For these broad spectrum products, higher SPF (Sun Protection Factor) values also indicate higher levels of overall protection. By contrast, any sunscreen not labeled as “Broad Spectrum” or that has an SPF value between 2 and 14, has only been shown to help prevent sunburn. Sunscreen products that are not broad spectrum or that are broad spectrum with SPF values from 2 to14 will be labeled with a warning that reads: “Skin Cancer/Skin Aging Alert: Spending time in the sun increases your risk of skin cancer and early skin aging.

The plant is also known as butterfly bush and mi meng hua. It has long been used in traditional Chinese and Korean medicine, mostly internally, but research is unveiling the impact it can have when applied to skin as well. Studies demonstrate that in addition to the antioxidant properties that nearly all plant extracts have, Buddleja officinalis flower extract is also rich in a type of antioxidant known as polyphenols, specifically verbascoside and echinacoside. These polyphenols have been shown to inhibit factors within skin that lead to visible signs of sun damage. This includes damage caused by UV rays as well as exposure to blue light. Some studies even point to this extract’s ability to counter redness and improve the look of discolorations. Usage levels of Buddleja officinalis flower extract range from 0.5-2% when blended in a water base with a glycol ingredient such as propanediol."

Research indicates butylene glycol not only helps raise water content in skin (aka hydration) but may also contribute to decreasing roughness on the surface of skin (depending on how it’s combined in the formula). While not known as a preservative in and of itself, some of butylene glycol’s properties can help boost a formula’s stability against microorganisms that may harm skin’s surface. As a raw material, butlyene glycol is a clear and viscous liquid. It is similar to propylene glycol but has a lighter texture. It is used in a wide range of concentrations, with reports of up to 50%, although many suppliers cap it at 30%. The minimum amount tends to hover around 0.5%, in which case it’s typically part of a blend with plant extracts and/or preservatives. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review board has evaluated several toxicology tests and other research concerning butylene glycol over the years and has determined it is safe within the wide concentration range currently used in cosmetics products. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has even determined that butylene glycol is safe as a food additive."

The results of a concentration use survey conducted reported by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) in 2018 indicated that butyloctyl salicylate is being used at concentrations up to 35.9% in leave-on products, including makeup (the highest concentration was found in lipsticks). For skin care products, the concentration is usually much lower (around 5% or less). The CIR Expert Panel concluded that butyloctyl salicylate is safe in the present practices of use, when formulated to be non-irritating and non-sensitizing."
Butylparaben,Good,,Preservative,,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skin care products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help."

Additionally, it can be used to alter the thickness of a formula or to influence the foaming capacity of a cleanser. It is almost always combined with similar-feeling ingredients to create a product’s texture and slip sensation when applied to skin. According to the U.S. FDA, cosmetic products labeled “alcohol free” are allowed to contain cetearyl alcohol, because the effects are so different from skin-damaging forms of alcohol. We repeat: fatty alcohols like cetearyl alcohol do not pose a risk of sensitizing or drying out your skin. As a raw material, cetearyl alcohol is a white, waxy solid (often in flake form). It is not soluble in water but is soluble in alcohol and oils. In the majority of skin care formulas, cetearyl alcohol is present in under a 5% concentration, although higher amounts are permissible. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review has a long history of recognizing cetearyl alcohol as safe in the present practices of use."

It is particularly popular in facial masks targeted at reducing skin’s surface oil. While its absorbent properties are helpful for those with oily skin, it can be drying for other skin types (especially if used in very high amounts). To avoid this issue, some formulators pair China clay with hydrating/soothing ingredients which work to offset some of its absorbency so skin benefits without feeling dry or tight. China clay’s other reported cosmetic functions include as an anticaking agent, bulking agent, and opacifying agent. Depending on how it’s supplied and what it’s formulated with, China clay can also function as an abrasive agent. As a raw material, China clay is a soft, white clay comprised predominantly of kaolinite, a hydrated aluminum silicate. According to the Personal Care Council, “Kaolin is extracted from kaolinized granite by washing it out with powerful and remote water hoses. The clay stream is then pumped to the separation plant where sand and mica are removed. The purified clay is filtered when wet and then dried. The very fine powder is formed by milling.” Purified China clay (kaolin) has a long history of safe use in cosmetics. Further supporting its safety, kaolin has been generally recognized as safe (also known as GRAS status) by the US FDA as a direct food additive."

It assists in the process of photosynthesis, turning sunlight into helpful energy plants need to thrive. Its name comes from being found in the chloroplasts (membrane portion) of cells, with the “phyll” portion of the name referring to the plant’s leaves. What does chlorophyll have to do with skin? As with most plant-derived compounds, it has antioxidant properties that help interrupt the cascade of damage on and within skin due to environmental exposure. It also possesses soothing action on skin, as evidenced by animal studies. Some research has shown that oral consumption of chlorophyll improves signs of sun damage, such as wrinkles and elasticity; however, more studies are needed to confirm these benefits plus account for other factors that may have contributed to the perceived results. Chlorophyll is also taken in supplement form to address various health concerns such as fatigue, seasonal allergies or as part of a dietary detox; however, there’s little research connecting this practice with proven benefits, and taking high doses of chlorophyll (3,000 milligrams) may cause gastrointestinal distress. Chlorophyll supplement tablets typically contain the synthetic derivative chlorophyllin, which is more stable. This green pigment is also used as a coloring agent in cosmetics; however, stability issues can occur since the amount of chlorophyll necessary to achieve an attractive green color may create textural and application issues for the formula. Usage levels for chlorophyll in cosmetics have not been established; however, it is not known to pose a risk to skin even when used in high amounts."

Chrysin,Good,,Antioxidant,"A flavonoid plant compound with antioxidant properties | Occurs naturally in honey, mushrooms, carrots, and passion fruit | Interrupts factors in skin that fuel the appearance of dark circles | Requires careful formulating to ensure bioavailability is adequate","Chrysin is a plant-derived compound that occurs naturally in honey, passion fruit, carrots and many types of mushrooms, among other plants. It’s a type of antioxidant known as a polyphenolic flavonoid. It has a signaling ability that helps reduce oxidative stress on skin. Also known as 5,7-dihydroxyflavone, chrysin has proven to be a powerful skin soother, helping to alleviate signs of irritation and discomfort, including from very dry skin. In vitro and in vivo studies have identified a compound in chrysin known as CPD 6 that is believed to deliver the bulk of its skin-calming benefits. Chrysin has also been shown to be valuable for reducing the look of dark circles. This is due to its ability to reduce excess melanin, which is a skin pigment whose excess accumulation around the eyes is a leading contributor to this common concern. Last, careful formulary techniques are required to stabilize chrysin and ensure its solubility in cosmetic formulas. Without such steps, its bioavailability is low. Various methods can be used to achieve this, including the use of complex sugars known as cyclodextrins, peptides, and fatty acid-based emulsifiers."

In beauty products, coconut alkanes functions as a solvent and skin-softening emollient. Alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons (common examples of hydrocarbons in cosmetics include mineral oil and paraffin). Suppliers of this ingredient describe it as a clear, oily, liquid emollient with a lightweight dry down on the skin similar to the lightweight solvent isodedecane. It’s often used in tandem with another coconut-derived ingredient, coco-caprylate/caprate. This duo is touted as an alternative to certain dry-finish silicones. Internet searches of coconut alkanes point to headlines about the comedogenicity of this ingredient and claim you should steer clear of it if you have acne-prone skin. In reality, this is a non-substantiated claim that you can ignore—what matters is the total blend of ingredients in the finished formula and how it interacts with your skin. If the overall formula leaves a heavy, occlusive, greasy feel on skin, then yes there’s potential it could clog pores and make breakouts worse, but that would be based on all of the emollient and oil-based ingredients, not just coconut alkanes."

Research also supports claims that Coix lacryma-jobi ma-yuen can function as a skin-brightening ingredient. It accomplishes this benefit through helping to curb excess pigment that would then go on to form visible dark spots and discolorations. We’ve also seen claims that this seed extract might have calming and hydrating properties, but more research needs to be completed to establish this as fact. Last, optimal usage levels for this ingredient have not been firmly established for use in cosmetics. It’s often part of a blend with other natural ingredients and ferments."
Collagen Amino Acids,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",Help hydrate skin | Serve as humectants | Can help improve skin health | Created through the hydrolysis of collagen,"Collagen amino acids help hydrate skin due to their humectant nature. They’re created through the hydrolysis (breaking down with water) of collagen proteins, which results in a high amount of a single amino acid, hydroxyproline; however, other amino acids, like glycine and proline, are also present in smaller amounts. Hydroxyproline serves to increase skin’s moisture levels and smoothness. Research also suggests that topically applied hydroxyproline and glycine (derived from fish collagen) can have a positive impact on healthy skin cell maturation. Collagen amino acids may be synthetic or animal-derived. Collagen amino acids are also used in the supplement industry in pill, gummy and powder forms. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reviewed collagen amino acids and determined them safe for use in cosmetics at current concentration levels (0.0003%-6.0%). Those who are vegan should check with the brand to ensure the collagen amino acids they’re using are not animal-derived."
Colloidal Gold,Good,,"Preservative, Solvent","Gold particles that have been nanosized so that they remain dispersed evenly throughout a solution | Offers antimicrobial/antifungal properties | May also be used to enhance the delivery/efficacy of other key ingredients | Although it is derived from gold, the two differ greatly in their cosmetic functions","Colloidal gold refers to gold particles that have been nanosized so that they remain dispersed evenly throughout a solution. According to the Personal Care Products Council, colloidal gold functions as an antimicrobial/antifungal or skin-conditioning agent. Recent research has shown colloidal gold can also be bonded with key antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), where it helps prevent molecule degradation and releases them more effectively into skin. Colloidal gold has been used in the world of medicine, where there is a minor amount of research showing that it might have benefit because of assumed skin-soothing properties. Although colloidal gold has not been formally assessed by the Cosmetics Ingredient Review Expert Panel, initial research has not demonstrated safety concerns. Skin permeation studies have demonstrated that spherical gold particles are non-toxic to human skin cells. t’s important to note that colloidal gold and traditional gold serve different purposes in the realm of cosmetics. Delving into the entry for Gold will offer deeper insights into their contrasting functions."

It is considered more nutrient rich than what is produced during the rest of lactation. The colostrum used in skin care is generally sourced from cows or goats and can have a yellowish coloration (whereas milk is grayish white). In studies, colostrum has been shown to protect against the erosion of the length of telomeres (compounds at the end of chromosomes) in skin and defend against oxidative stress, enhancing skin health and decreasing the visible effects of skin aging. Some research also points to colostrum having the ability to disrupt factors that trigger dark spots and discolorations. Colostrum can be considered an upcycled ingredient since it is often a byproduct of commercial milk production. Usage levels of colostrum in cosmetics haven’t been firmly established; however, its safety isn’t in question for topical use."

Copper Peptides,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Peptides that combine the element copper with three amino acids | Occur naturally in the body | Synthetically created copper peptides can have anti-aging benefits | More research is needed to verify their benefit,"Copper peptides combine the element copper with three amino acids. Copper peptides occur naturally in the body, and is a growing body of research concerning how copper peptides may improve the appearance of multiple signs of aging, but this concerns synthetic, lab-engineered peptides. Are copper peptides finally the anti-aging answer? No. Although there’s some convincing research demonstrating copper bound with peptides has skin-smoothing benefit, those studies were set up and paid for by companies selling the ingredient complex or selling products that contain it, typically marketed as GHK-copper. What’s more, these studies rarely, if ever, compare the allegedly wonderful results of copper peptides other, more established ingredients."
Copper Tripeptide-1,Good,,"Antioxidant, Peptides","Sends reparative signals to key proteins in skin’s extracellular matrix | Supports skin’s collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (such as hyaluronic acid) | Also provides antioxidant and skin-soothing benefits | Results may include increased skin firmness/density and visibly minimized fine lines/wrinkles | Studies show there is potential for increased hair growth (which may limit appeal for skin care)","Copper tripeptide-1 is made up of three amino acids (glycine, histidine, and lysine) combined with the mineral copper. This complex is naturally present within bodily fluids, but as a skin care ingredient, it is created synthetically in the lab. In the most basic sense, it is categorized as a skin conditioning ingredient, but research indicates copper tripeptide-1 is capable of much more in terms of its anti-aging abilities. That said, the potential for increased hair growth while using products that contain this ingredient does limit the appeal of copper tripeptide-1 for some people, hence holding it back from receiving a BEST rating. Copper tripeptide-1 is known as a signaling peptide due to the way it sends reparative signals by targeting key proteins in skin’s extracellular matrix. It is noted in research for supporting collagen and elastin production and increasing glycosaminoglycans (i.e. replenishing/hydrating substances like hyaluronic acid). This translates to benefits such as increasing skin’s firmness and density, while decreasing the appearance of fine lines/wrinkles. Research indicates it may also play a role in extending skin’s healthspan (also known as skin longevity). Additionally, copper tripeptide-1 has been shown to provide antioxidant and skin-soothing benefits. We must also point out that the potential for hair growth stimulation is mentioned as a side effect in some studies of copper tripeptide-1. While that could be beneficial if you’re wanting to incite hair growth, on the flipside, it would be a deterrent if you do not want to stimulate hair growth (such as on the face) while using skin care products that contain copper tripeptide-1. Searching the web, anecdotal results are mixed regarding this matter. More studies are needed to conclusively rule on these findings. The Cosmetics Ingredient Review 2018 safety assessment deemed copper tripeptide-1 safe as used in cosmetics. While their report did not call out recommended usage levels, suppliers of this ingredient suggest concentrations between 0.05-1%. Copper tripeptide-1 also goes by the abbreviated chemical name GHK-Cu or tradename GHK-copper or may be referred to simply as copper peptides or GHK."
Cornstarch,Good,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Absorbent, Plant Extracts",,"Starch obtained from corn and sometimes used as an absorbent in cosmetics instead of or alongside talc.

Crambe Abyssinica Seed Oil,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Plant Extracts",Plant-derived oil extracted from Crambe abyssinica seeds | Emollient that helps skin seal in moisture | Contains soothing linoleic and oleic acids | Safe for used in cosmetics,"Crambe abyssinica seed oil, also known as Abyssinian seed oil, is an emollient plant-derived oil extracted from the seeds of the Crambe abyssinica plant. This plant is native to Ethiopia, though it can now be found in other locations. Applied topically, this non-fragrant seed oil forms a protective layer over the skin which helps it retain moisture. This promotes hydration, giving skin a soft, smooth and plump appearance. Crambe abyssinica contains soothing linoleic and oleic acids. However, it’s erucic acid, an omega-9 fatty acid that helps the skin to seal in moisture, which makes up most of this seed oil’s profile. Crambe abyssinica seed oil contains between 50 and 65% erucic acid. This particular omega fatty acid is common within oils produced from members of the Brassicaceae family, of which Crambe abyssinica is one. Due to its hydrating and conditioning qualities, this ingredient is also used in hair care formulations. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel determined that Crambe abyssinica seed oil is safe for use in cosmetics. The oil is used in cosmetics in amounts ranging between 0.1–20%."
Cucumber Extract,Good,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",Non-sensitizing plant-extract | Contains antioxidant compounds | Can help protect skin from external agents | Has non-irritating fragrant compounds,"Non-sensitizing plant extract (also known by its Latin name of _Cucumis sativus_).

Due to its antioxidant activity, cucumber is a welcome addition to anti-aging products. Cucumber contains fragrant components that are not sensitizing to skin (a rarity) so it can be used to enhance the natural scent of a cosmetic product without issue. While this ingredient is often reported to be useful for improving the appearance of puffy eyes there is not adequate, reliable research to support this contention. In case you’re wondering: The act of placing slightly chilled cucumber slices over the eye may help reduce puffiness, but that’s not because the cucumber has de-puffing properties.

Cyclodextrin,Good,,"Suspending/Dispersing Agent, Chelating Agent","Derived from cornstarch and made via biotechnology | Used in cosmetics to stabilize and help solubilize key ingredients | Has absorbent properties when used at higher levels | Helps keep delicate ingredients protected from light, air, and heat","Cyclodextrin is a cyclic (that’s what the “cyclo” portion of its name means) complex sugar (dextran) known as a polysaccharide. It is obtained from plants and produced for cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals via biotechnology involving a reaction between enzymes and cornstarch. Available in three different shapes depending on application need, cyclodextrin works in cosmetics as an absorbent, chelating agent, and more importantly helps stabilize, solubilize and ensure delivery of key ingredients to skin. For example, cyclodextrins can make water-soluble ingredients more oil-soluble, enhancing their penetration and bioavailability. They can also protect delicate ingredients from degradation due to light, air and heat exposure. As the sugars in the cyclodextrin break down, the ingredients contained inside their hollow center are released. Since cyclodextrin is a food-grade ingredient considered safe to consume, it is also deemed safe as used in cosmetics. It’s considered non-irritating and non-sensitizing. Usage levels in cosmetics vary depending on formulary goals and ingredients being encapsulated in the cyclodextrins. A typical usage range falls between 0.3–10%."
Cyclohexasiloxane,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Silicone, Emollient, Solvent","Synthetic silicone known for its lightweight, non-greasy, silky feel | Helps enhance skin’s hydration | Acts as a carrier to deliver other ingredients effectively and evenly | Can be found in a wide range of skin care, makeup, hair care and other personal care products | Deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel","Cyclohexasiloxane is one of several forms of synthetic, cyclic (meaning the molecule is circular rather than straight or crosslinked) silicone used in cosmetic formulas to improve texture and enhance skin’s hydration. It helps give skin care products a silky-smooth, spreadable consistency, so key ingredients can be delivered evenly to skin. It is also known to promote aesthetically pleasing finishes that don’t feel sticky, tacky or greasy after application. In hair care, it is used to add shine and reduce frizz. As a raw material, cyclohexasiloxane is a colorless liquid. It is described as a lightweight carrier ingredient since it evaporates from skin, leaving behind the formula’s key ingredients to work effectively. This ingredient has been deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (their report looked at products using between 0.0004-48% cyclohexasiloxane)."

It is a lightweight silicone, whose appearance as a raw material is a clear, odorless fluid. Cyclopentasiloxane also functions as a solvent to help improve the dispersion of cosmetic ingredients in a solution and improve delivery of key ingredients. Cyclopentasiloxane is categorized as a volatile silicone, but it’s important to distinguish that the word volatile here doesn’t mean irritating to skin. Instead, it means this kind of silicone evaporates quickly from skin’s surface, which is one of the advantages of formulating with cyclopentasiloxane as it is able to evenly distribute other key ingredients without leaving a heavy or occlusive feel. It also means you don’t have to worry about cyclopentasiloxane “trapping” or “congesting” skin (as is also true for other silicones). The velvety film left behind is permeable, meaning this siloxane doesn’t suffocate skin. Cyclopentasiloxane also shows up in hair care formulas (particularly conditioners and hair serums) where it lends a softening + smoothing feel and makes hair remarkably shiny. While cyclopentasiloxane is typically the name that you’ll see on a product’s ingredient list, it also goes by cyclomethicone D5 or just D5 in research literature. According to the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel’s assessment (as reported in 2011), cyclopentasiloxane can safely be used in up to 93% in personal care products. It does not pose a health risk to skin as used in cosmetic products. Cyclopentasiloxane is under regulatory review in the European Union."

OneSkin claims this peptide interrupts the process of cellular senescence. This process occurs when cells that have stopped proliferating (sometimes referred to as “zombie cells”) send out pro-aging factors to surrounding cells, creating a waterfall effect that leads to visible signs of aging. In essence, the ongoing presence of senescent cells gets the good cells to do bad things that impact skin’s health and appearance. Limited research at this time indicates decapeptide-52 might indeed be able to interrupt the process of cellular senescence, though it must be noted that most studies have been conducted by either OneSkin (which developed this peptide) or people associated with the brand. While we’re cautiously optimistic about the potential of this ingredient, more independent studies must be conducted before determining if it’s a must-add to your skin care routine."

It’s used in cosmetics for its emollient, plasticizing, and solvent properties. It may be plant-derived or synthetic. Note that despite isopropyl alcohol being part of what creates this ingredient, the result does not maintain the skin-irritating effects that type of alcohol has. Along with skin-softening benefits, it can also improve product spread, boost penetration of water-soluble ingredients, and help make heavier emollients such as petrolatum feel less greasy without losing their moisturizing abilities. This ingredient is supplied as a clear, colorless, odorless liquid with fluid properties. Fun fact: diisopropyl sebacate is used in underarm deodorants to prevent a whitening effect on skin (the kind that transfers to clothes). Usage levels of diisopropyl sebacate in skin care range from 1–10%. It is sometimes used as a replacement for silicones because it replicates some of the enviable sensory qualities this group has. Diisopropyl sebacate’s safety as used in cosmetics has been assessed. It’s considered non-irritating to skin and mildly irritating to eyes should direct contact occur."

It is often paired with pure dimethicone, a silicone that has documented protective and hydrating properties. Dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer can also be used as a thickener for water-in-oil formulations. Because of the complex nature of this polymer, its properties can vary from one supplier to another. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel found dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer is safe as used in skin care products. Its review determined that the size of this ingredient’s molecules is not able to penetrate skin. It was also not found to be irritating or sensitizing even in concentrations exceeding 45%."
Dimethicone Copolyol,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Silicone, Emollient",,"Dimethicone copolyol is a type of silicone, a substance derived from silica (sand is a silica). The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients."
Dimethicone Crosspolymer,Good,,"Silicone, Texture Enhancer, Polymer","A derivative of the silicone dimethicone | Used as a stabilizer, suspending agent, and thickener | Considered safe as used in cosmetics | Is non-occlusive, meaning it does not “suffocate” skin","Dimethicone crosspolymer is a silicone derivative used as a stabilizing and suspending agent or as a thickener in skin care products, almost always with pure dimethicone or another type of silicone. In its raw form, dimethicone crosspolymer is a gel. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has found dimethicone crosspolymer safe as used in cosmetics, and found that because of its larger molecule size, it does not penetrate skin. In leave-on products, it is used in amounts up to 25%. In recent years, silicone and its derivatives have been scrutinized amid claims that they “suffocate” skin, leading to clogged pores and increased acne breakouts, yet research hasn’t substantially proven that. In fact – again because of molecular size and configuration– silicones allow other ingredients to go past skin’s surface, yet they remain on top. Because of their porous nature, silicones are also light and non-occlusive, meaning they provide moisturizing properties without feeling thick or heavy."
Dimethiconol,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Silicone, Emollient",Skin-conditioning emollient that helps preserve hydration | Enhances formulary texture for more elegant aesthetics | Also used in hair care products as a conditioning agent | Deemed a safe cosmetic ingredient by the CIR Expert Panel,"Dimethiconol is a silicone-based liquid polymer that works as a skin-conditioning agent (emollient) and antifoaming agent in cosmetic formulas. It multitasks by helping lubricate skin’s surface (without feeling greasy) to enhance hydration, while modifying the formula’s texture for a more pleasant consistency. It can also be used in hair care products as a conditioning agent and is sometimes included in hair dyes to help the color resist wash out. Dimethiconol is often combined with other compounds and molecules to form derivatives such as dimethiconol arginine, dimethiconol beeswax, dimethiconol cysteine, and dimethiconol meadowfoamate—each with their own distinctive properties and functions.

In cosmetics, it functions primarily as a chelating agent, meaning it prevents ingredients in a formula from binding with trace elements (mainly minerals) that can be present in water or other ingredients. This action enhances the stability of cosmetics formulas and helps makes the job of preservatives easier since EDTA ingredients bond with mineral ions that microorganisms need to remain intact. In addition to being used in makeup, skin care, and hair care products, disodium EDTA is also used as a food additive. In several studies, the Cosmetics Review Board has found that as used in cosmetics products, disodium EDTA is safe. It was determined that in the concentrations used in commercial cosmetics, it is not a skin sensitizer nor a carcinogen, and does not penetrate through skin. The highest concentration of disodium EDTA used in leave-on products is 0.85% (for hair color sprays)."

Dromiceius Oil,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient",,"Dromiceius oil comes from Dromaius novaehollandiae , also known as the emu, a large, flightless bird indigenous to Australia. The oil contains several fatty acids, including myristic, palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. Emu oil has become an important component of the Australian economy. As a result there is research from that part of the world showing it to be a good emollient that can help restore skin. But along with the evidence that emu oil is a good emollient and the parade of companies promoting it for that, there are also companies promoting products containing emu oil for its anti-aging properties. So does emu oil live up to these acclaimed properties? Regrettably, none of these promises are supported by research. A study looked at the “Cosmetic and moisturizing properties of Emu oil... assessed in a double-blind clinical study. Emu oil in comparison to mineral oil was found overall to be more cosmetically acceptable and had better skin penetration/permeability.” Like many ingredients, it has soothing, emollient properties, but it isn’t the miracle marketers make it out to be. Emu oil’s reputation is driven mostly by claims made by companies selling products that contain it, and not by any real proof that it is an essential requirement for skin."

It comes from the coneflower plant (aka _Echinacea_). This variety of Echinacea contains antioxidants, alkylamides, glycoproteins and polysaccharides, all of which contribute to its benefits for skin. Notably, the phenolic compounds present in Echinacea angustifolia help protect the skin from environmental stressors that would otherwise accelerate signs of aging such as wrinkles and uneven tone. Echinacea angustifolia roots can yield volatile essential oil (EO) compounds but fortunately only in trace amounts (0.1%) that are unlikely to be problematic when this ingredient included as part of a skin care formula. This is reassuring since a higher concentration of these volatile compounds could potentially cause skin irritation. Some cosmetic suppliers of this plant extract claim it can treat acne; however, independent research has not shown this to be true. Based on the limited safety data available, echinacea appears to be generally well tolerated. However, further research is needed to firmly establish its safety profile. NOTE: Echinacea species belong to the Asteraceae family of plants. As a precautionary measure, individuals with established allergies to other members of this plant family (like chamomile) should exercise caution when incorporating echinacea-based skincare into their regimen."

In one study, echinacea proved effective at curbing itchiness on the skin and scalp. Phenolic compounds present in Echinacea purpurea , including chicoric acid, help protect the skin from aggressive environmental agents that, when left unchecked, can cause fine lines, wrinkles and uneven tone. Ingredient suppliers recommend using this plant extract in cosmetic formulas at 0.1%. Despite fairly widespread use, including in supplements and over-the-counter cold remedies, the safety of echinacea has yet to be firmly established."

Examples of emollients are ingredients like plant oils, mineral oil, shea butter, cocoa butter, petrolatum, and fatty acids (animal oils, including emu, mink, and lanolin, the latter probably the one ingredient that is most like our own skin’s oil). More technical-sounding emollient ingredients, such as triglycerides, benzoates, myristates, palmitates, and stearates, are generally waxy in texture and appearance but provide most moisturizers with their elegant texture and feel."
Emulsifier,Good,,"Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer",,"In cosmetics, an emulsifier includes any ingredient that helps keep unlike ingredients (such as oil and water) from separating in an emulsion. Examples of cosmetics ingredients that function as emulsifiers include polysorbates, laureth-4, and potassium cetyl sulfate. Emulsifiers are widely used throughout the cosmetics industry and are the unsung heroes of many cosmetics formulas that blend and help to keep unlike ingredients together. There is also research showing they can help enhance the absorption of skincare ingredients and may be useful for prolonged topical delivery."
Emu Oil,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient",,"The emu (_Dromaius novaehollandiae_) is a large, flightless bird indigenous to Australia. The oil contains several fatty acids, including myristic, palmitic, oleic, linoleic, and linolenic acids. Emu oil has become an important component of the Australian economy. As a result there is research from that part of the world showing it to be a good emollient that can help restore skin. But along with the evidence that emu oil is a good emollient and the parade of companies promoting it for that, there are also companies promoting products containing emu oil for its antiaging properties. So does emu oil live up to these acclaimed properties? Regrettably, none of these promises are supported by research. A study looked at the “Cosmetic and moisturizing properties of Emu oil... assessed in a double-blind clinical study. Emu oil in comparison to mineral oil was found overall to be more cosmetically acceptable and had better skin penetration/permeability.” Like many ingredients, it has soothing, emollient properties, but it isn’t the miracle marketers make it out to be. Emu oil’s reputation is driven mostly by claims made by companies selling products that contain it, and not by any real proof that it is an essential requirement for skin."
Enzymes,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Exfoliant",,"Vast group of proteins, produced by all living things, that act alone or with other ingredients as catalysts in chemical and biological reactions. Enzymes are divided into six main categories: oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, and ligases. The names of most, but not all, enzymes end in -ase. Enzymes are used in skincare products to prompt exfoliation. Most enzymes are finicky about how and under what conditions they will act. Sometimes several enzymes are required to carry out a particular reaction, and their actions are affected by temperature and pH. Some enzymes depend on the presence of other enzymes, called coenzymes, to function, or they depend on a specific body temperature. It would require an exceptionally complicated process to stimulate enzyme activity via topical application to skin."
Epigallocatechin Gallatyl Glucoside,Good,"Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Soothing, Antioxidant, Humectant",Skin-conditioning agent and soothing antioxidant | Derived from epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and glucose | Claims about treating dark circles and under-eye bags are not currently supported by research | May be easier to formulate with compared to traditional EGCG,"Epigallocatechin gallatyl glucoside is a derivative of a well-known, tea-derived antioxidant in the skin care world: epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG for short). It is obtained from the reaction of EGCG and glucose. While independent studies on epigallocatechin gallatyl glucoside are lacking, it is said to function as an antioxidant and skin-conditioning agent, which checks out given the ingredients it comes from. EGCG is backed by research for offering skin-soothing properties and helping to defend skin from the effects sun damage. It is the major antioxidant component of green tea. Glucose is a natural sugar that offers humectant and other skin-beneficial properties. Epigallocatechin gallatyl glucoside is touted by many brands as helping to address eye area concerns such as dark circles and under-eye bags; however we could not find peer-reviewed research to confirm these benefits. We can, however, theorize that this is a good anti-aging ingredient given its relationship to EGCG. Ingredient manufacturers suggest that due to its water solubility, epigallocatechin gallatyl glucoside may offer better formulary compatibility compared to traditional EGCG. At the time of this writing, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review has not conducted a formal safety assessment on epigallocatechin gallatyl glucoside. Our research did not reveal any known concerns about using this ingredient in skin care or personal care products. Usage levels range between 0.01–0.05%."

Erythrulose,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Coloring Agent/Pigment, Humectant",,"Substance chemically similar to the self-tanning agent dihydroxyacetone. Depending on your skin color, there can be a difference in the color with erythrulose. Erythrulose needs about two to three days for the skin to show a color change, while dihydroxyacetone completely changes the color of skin within two to six hours. For this reason, most products that contain erythrulose also contain dihydroxyacetone."
Ester,Good,,Emollient,,"A compound formed from the reaction between an alcohol and an acid via the elimination of water. Triesters (groups of three esters) form the backbone of many fats, waxes, and oils that have emollient and skin-conditioning properties.

It’s particularly popular in sunless tanning products due to the way it facilitates smooth spreading and minimizes streaking. It can also be found in numerous other personal care products ranging from skin care serums to hair dyes. When used in skin care products, it is known to help key ingredients absorb more effectively. Ethoxydiglycol also goes by the name diethylene glycol monoethyl ether and is marketed under the trademarked ingredient name Transcutol®. As a raw material it appears as a clear liquid and is water soluble. In 2013, the European Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety concluded that the use of ethoxydiglycol does not pose a risk in leave-on cosmetic formulations at a maximum concentration of 2.6% “taking into account the other uses previously assessed (10% in rinse-off products, 7.0% in oxidative and 5% in non-oxidative hair dye formulation).”"
Ethylcellulose,Good,,"Film-Forming Agent, Texture Enhancer, Solvent","Naturally derived from wood pulp or cotton | Used in cosmetics to enhance texture, create films, and work as a solvent | Allows the creation of clear fluid or gel formulas | Considered safe as used in food and cosmetics","Ethylcellulose is a plant-derived (from cotton or wood pulp) carbohydrate polymer that’s used in cosmetics for its solvent, texture-enhancing and film-forming properties. Used in makeup, it can help brighten and improve the shine quality of cosmetic pigments. Adding ethylcellulose to skin care formulas can help create clear gels in a range of viscosities (thicknesses). It’s supplied as a colorless powder that plays well with other solvents when added to the oil phase of a formula. It also works well with various glycerides and UV filters, including octinoxate and homosalate. This ingredient is also known as ethyl ether cellulose. It’s a food-grade ingredient used to help oils gel. As such, it’s considered safe as used in cosmetics. Usage levels of ethylcellulose in cosmetics range from 0.5–10%."
Ethylene/Propylene/Styrene/Copolymer,Good,,"Polymer, Texture Enhancer",Texture enhancing polymer | Creates gel textures in oil-based formulas | Can help to create occlusive barriers | Often used in conjunction with butylene/ethylene/styrene copolymer,"Ethylene/propylene/styrene copolymer is a synthetic polymer used in skin care to help thicken and create gel textures in oil-based formulas. This polymer, or compound with a high molecular weight made up of smaller parts, is created when the hydrocarbons ethylene, propylene and styrene are joined together and then terminated through a process called hydrogenation. Due to its status as a gelling agent, this copolymer improves the sensorial experience of formulas and can help to create an occlusive barrier that prevents transepidermal water loss, ultimately helping hydrate skin. Ethylene/propylene/styrene copolymer is often used alongside butylene/ethylene/styrene copolymer. In cosmetics, it’s often used in levels between 0.5-1.5%. It’s considered safe as used in cosmetics, with amounts double to three times what’s typically used being non-irritating to skin and only mildly irritating to eyes."
Ethyl Ferulate,Good,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant","Forms from esterification (combining of alcohols and acids) of ferulic acid and ethyl alcohol | Helps protect skin from environmental stressors that can lead to signs of aging | Has soothing benefits when formulated in emulsions | Often found in sunscreen products due to its supporting role in thwarting UV damage | Naturally occurring, though mostly produced synthetically for cosmetic purposes","Ethyl ferulate is an ester of the powerful antioxidant ferulic acid and ethyl alcohol. Much like its parent acid, ethyl ferulate functions as an antioxidant, helping to neutralize the impact of external aggressors that contribute to signs of aging and is particularly adept at supporting skin’s defenses when exposed to UV light. This particular benefit is why ethyl ferulate is often incorporated into sunscreens. Further research has shown that ethyl ferulate can help soothe skin in the face of environmental stressors, like UV rays and pollution, when added to creams and lotions. Although ethyl ferulate is most commonly created for the purpose of cosmetic use through synthetic esterification, it can also be isolated from rice bran oil. As a raw material, it often appears as a creamy white powder or as granules of the same color. In cosmetic formulations, it’s most often found between concentrations of 0.5% and 1%. Toxicity testing has confirmed the safety of this ingredient."

In its raw form it is a pale, straw-colored liquid. Ethylhexyl cocoate is used in cosmetics in concentrations ranging from 0.01–41%. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient has ruled it safe as used in current practices. It lends a silky feel that improves product application and can also reduce the “soaping” effect moisturizer formulas may develop."
Ethylhexylglycerin,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Preservative, Humectant",Skin-softening agent with mild humectant (hydration boosting) properties | Multitasks with preservative capabilities to improve formulary stability | Also popular in deodorants where it has an inhibiting effect on odor-causing bacteria | Proven track record of safety | Pale to colorless liquid as a raw material,"Ethylhexylglycerin is a synthetic skin-softening agent. Ethylhexylglycerin can also be used as a preservative and carrier/suspending agent that boosts the efficacy of other preservatives such as phenoxyethanol. It has been shown to have mild humectant properties leading to improved skin hydration without a sticky feel. Ethylhexylglycerin is also popular in deodorant formulas where it has an inhibiting effect on odor-causing bacteria. Antibacterial action is also where it earns its keep as a preservative, but since it isn’t effective against other type of pathogens, it would always be used with more broad-spectrum preservatives. As a raw material, ethylhexylglycerin is a pale to colorless liquid. It is formed by a condensation reaction between 2-ethyhexanol (an oil-like ingredient) and glycerin. In 2013, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed ethylhexylglycerin as safe used in up to 8% concentration in rinse-off products and up to 2% in leave-on formulas. Studies regarding sensitization patch tests of 5% ethylhexylglycerin show that reactions to this ingredient are very rare and their occurrence in a broad population is considered low risk."
Ethylhexyl Hydroxystearate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient","Skin-conditioning emollient that delivers a soft, smooth after feel | Locks in moisture without producing a tacky finish | Can be used to add glossy shine to lip care and hair care formulations | Deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel","Ethylhexyl hydroxystearate is a skin-conditioning emollient that delivers a soft, smooth after feel. Suppliers of this ingredient tout its ability to lubricate skin’s surface and lock in moisture, without creating a tacky finish. It can also be used to add glossy shine to lip care and hair care formulations. Ethylhexyl hydroxystearate has been shown to be effective in low concentrations but can safely be used in higher concentrations up to 18%, according to the 2015 Cosmetic Ingredient Review safety assessment."
Ethylhexyl Isononanoate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient",Isononanoic acid and 2-ethylhexyl alcohol ester | Hydrates skin through water loss prevention | Helps boost skin’s softness | CIR Expert Panel deemed safe for use in cosmetics,"Ethylhexyl isononanoate is an ester of isononanoic acid and 2-ethylhexyl alcohol used in skin care for its emollient properties. This water-insoluble ester has a lighter skin feel than other emollient skin care ingredients, allowing for lighter, more spreadable formulas. It hydrates and softens skin by trapping moisture and preventing water loss. This ingredient is a clear, liquid raw material that appears in formulas in percentages between 0.02-75%. The CIR Expert Panel reviewed ethylhexyl isononanoate and deemed it safe for use in cosmetics at current formulaic concentrations."
Ethylhexyl Methoxycrylene,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Texture Enhancer, Solvent, UV Filters","UV absorber and stabilizing ingredient for sunscreen actives | Also helps stabilize antioxidants such as vitamin A (retinol) | Can be used as a solvent to enhance formulary texture, leading to more pleasing aesthetics. | Viscous yellow liquid in raw material form","The research for ethylhexyl methoxycrylene mainly focuses on its effectiveness as a UV absorber and stabilizing ingredient for sunscreen actives. Because it enhances UV protection, ethylhexyl methoxycrylene can be considered an anti-aging ingredient. Similarly, studies show ethylhexyl methoxycrylene in amounts between 4–5% helps stabilize formulas containing vitamin A ingredients, as well as other antioxidants such as trans-resveratrol and ubiquinone. Another function of ethylhexyl methoxycrylene is that it can be used as a solvent to enhance formulary texture, leading to more pleasing aesthetics. Suppliers of this ingredient describe it as a viscous yellow liquid in its raw material form."
Ethylhexyl Palmitate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Solvent, Texture Enhancer",Helps soften and smooth skin | Reduces moisture loss from skin’s upper layers | Can help active ingredients more readily penetrate skin | Is used as an alternative to silicone in some skin care products,"Ethylhexyl palmitate is a mixture of a fatty alcohol and palmitic acid that functions in cosmetics products as an emollient (meaning it can soften and smooth skin), texture enhancer, and solvent in amounts from 2-50%, depending on the type of formula and desired aesthetics. It improves the look of skin, particularly dry skin, by helping reduce moisture loss from its upper layers. As a solvent, it helps solubilize other ingredients, helping active ingredients more readily penetrate skin. It helps sunscreen active ingredients such as avobenzone and ethylhexyl triazone disperse and remain evenly suspended in a formula. Ethylhexyl palmitate has a feel like some silicones and silicone derivatives, making it an alternative to those ingredients in certain formulations. There’s no research indicating this ingredient, which may be synthetic, plant-, or animal-derived, is a problem for skin. Paula’s Choice Skincare uses either the synthetic or plant-derived form of this ingredient depending on the product."
Ethylhexyl Stearate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emulsifier, Emollient, Texture Enhancer",Emollient that delivers skin-softening properties and a smooth after feel | Acts as a lubricant on skin's surface to help lock in moisture | Can be used as a solvent for other ingredients in skin care formulations | Works as texture enhancer to improve the consistency of skin care products | Also known as octyl stearate,Ethylhexyl stearate is commonly used as an emollient to deliver skin-softening properties and a smooth after feel. It acts as a lubricant on skin’s surface to help lock in moisture. Ethylhexyl stearate can also work as a solvent for other ingredients and improve the consistency of skin care products. Ethylhexyl stearate also goes by the name octyl stearate and falls under a category of ingredients known as stearate esters. Stearate esters have been assessed in numerous studies by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review CIR Expert Panel with a safe track record whether used in high or low concentrations.
Ethyl Macadamiate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Plant Extracts, Emollient, Emulsifier","Plant-derived or synthetically made ingredient that is sometimes used as a substitute for silicones | Imparts emollient, skin-softening properties without a greasy feel | Adds a pleasant slip to creams and lotions, making them easier to spread | Source of essential fatty acids for skin","Ethyl macadamiate is the ester of ethyl alcohol mixed with fatty acids from macadamia nut oil to create an emollient. On skin, ethyl macadamiate softens and conditions plus helps prevent moisture loss. This plant-derived or synthetically made ingredient is sometimes used as a substitute for silicones because it imparts emollient, skin-softening properties without the greasy feel higher amounts of some silicones can have. Ethyl macadamiate also adds a pleasant slip to creams and lotions, making them easier to spread, not to mention macadamia nut oil is a rich source of essential fatty acids for skin. You can find ethyl macadamiate in all kinds of cosmetic formulations including cleansing oils, moisturizers, sunscreens, and hair care products. Amounts used in cosmetics may be as low as 0.1% in a cleanser to upwards of 30% in a non-aqueous serum or moisturizer. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has deemed macadamia nut oil safe as used in cosmetics; the ethyl alcohol portion isn’t considered a risk since it does not retain its original properties when esterified with oil to form ethyl macadamiate."
Ethylparaben,Good,,Preservative,,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skin care products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help."

Exosomes,Good,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant","Cell-communicating and transporting ingredients | Best known for anti-aging, antioxidant and soothing properties | Deliver integral substances to cells in need | Topical application of exosomes faces skin penetration roadblocks | Lack a wealth and breadth of scientific research, but hundreds of clinical trials are ongoing","Exosomes are a type of extracellular vesicle, which is a small particle surrounded by a lipid layer. These nano-sized, cell-communicating pouches cannot divide like cells but instead transport materials integral to cells’ health, like proteins, lipids, nucleic acids and growth factors, between cells. Exosomes aren’t exclusive to humans (where they’re most notably found in stem cells, and bodily fluids): they’re also found in plants and animals. Although they’re all the rage right now, research confirming their topical efficaciousness and how to best isolate, stabilize and validate their results is limited but potentially promising. In theory, exosomes can help restore and rejuvenate skin cells impacted by aging, senescence, stress and environmental damage. They do this via the delivery of vital substances that support healthy collagen and elastin levels, combat enzymes that break down the extracellular matrix, help soothe and repair and serve as antioxidants. Some researchers are optimistic that exosome technology will be able to deliver visible benefits to aging skin previously thought impossible, but these benefits, such as helping to reverse facial fat atrophy, remain to be proven. When used on skin, they’re most often applied after in-office treatments and procedures like microneedling and peels because exosomes cannot penetrate the epidermis without assistance. In-office procedures provide them with a “gateway” to get into skin and get to work. However, some cosmetic brands claim they’ve found a way to formulate exosomes to penetrate skin without a procedure-assisted gateway. In the cosmetic realm, there are three types of exosomes: 1) Natural, meaning derived from plants or animals. Although these tiny exosomes are structurally intact, they are less stable than other types. 2) Synthetic, mimics the properties of natural, but with a different molecular structure that’s consistent and stable. 3) Modified, which fuses natural and synthetic exosomes. Their contents and surface charge (which impacts their ability to cling to skin) can be customized. It may seem counter-intuitive, but the synthetic and hybrid exosomes for cosmetics have the best position for potential efficacy, stability, standardization, safety and consistent results. Another area where exosomes are generating enthusiasm is as a delivery system. Their small size and general biocompatibility with skin’s surface can be used to deliver other cosmetic ingredients such as antioxidants and soothing agents further into skin, potentially enhancing or prolonging their benefits. The research regarding exosomes for skin is exciting, but still in the beginning stages. There are few in-vivo studies, with most preclinical studies focused on gathering info on exosomes and their methods of action. Beyond this, medical researchers have yet to determine a standardized isolation and validation technique for exosomes (which would make sure all exosomes extracted only transport beneficial substances) and continue to struggle to nail down realistic preservation practices. There’s also still mystery behind how to best formulate for skin penetration and inclusion within cosmetics. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has yet to review exosomes and predictable use levels have not been established for cosmetics. Outside of skin care, research is determining medical applications for these interesting cell-communicators."

They’re composed of short chains of 3–10 fructose units. They occur naturally in plants and are often found in garlic, sugar beets, chicory, onion and banana, among other fruits and vegetables. Although natural, fructooligosaccharides can also be synthetically created via fermentation for usage in cosmetics. As a humectant, this ingredient helps promote skin’s moisture retention for a supple feel. It further nourishes and supports a healthy skin microbiome through its prebiotic properties. Prebiotics are the food source for probiotics, the “good” bacteria that helps the body and skin’s surface retain microbial balance. Recent studies also detail the potential antioxidant activity of fructooligosaccharides. This group of ingredients are safe for use in cosmetics without concentration restrictions. Fructooligosaccharides are often included in food products for their prebiotic effects as well as their sweet flavor."

Glucose,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Prebiotic/Probiotic/Postbiotic",Plant-derived sugar used as a humectant | Adds flavor to lip balms and facial cleansers | Works as a prebiotic to support skin’s microbiome | Also known as dextrose,"Glucose is a natural sugar that’s often obtained for cosmetics via the breakdown of various natural starches, which are also carbohydrates. As a humectant, it helps bind moisture to skin, adds flavor to lip products and facial cleansers, and is part of many saccharides that work as prebiotics to help reinforce skin’s microbiome. Research has shown 2% concentrations of glucose plays a role in fading the look discolorations because skin metabolizes it to lactic acid. It stands to reason that a leave-on lactic acid exfoliant would do this job more efficiently, especially if used with other hyperpigmentation helpersingredients such as vitamin C and niacinamide. This polysaccharide ingredient is supplied as an odorless white powder. Usage levels have not been established for cosmetics, but glucose is considered safe as used."
Glucose Oxidase,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Preservative",Enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the sugar glucose to gluconic acid | Functions as a skin conditioning ingredient | Synthesized by fungi and insects and can be manufactured synthetically | Has medical and food applications,"Glucose oxidase is an enzyme that catalyzes the oxidation of the sugar glucose to gluconic acid. In nature it is synthesized by several species of fungi and insects such as honeybees. It can also be manufactured synthetically (Paula’s Choice uses this version). In cosmetics, it functions as a skin-conditioning agent. Glucose oxidase is also used in medicine to help monitor glucose levels, and in the food industry to control glucose amounts. The ester of gluconic acid is known as gluconolactone, a polyhydroxy acid (PHA) that in amounts of 2% and up and within the correct pH range has exfoliating properties for skin."

In cosmetic formulas, glutamic acid is typically synthetic, although it can also be derived from animals and plants. It’s considered a non-essential amino acid since it naturally occurs in the human body. Glutamic acid takes the form of crystals as a raw cosmetic material. It is related to the increasingly popular humectant polyglutamic acid, which is essentially multiple glutamic acid molecules bound together. Glutamic acid has been deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review. Their assessment surveyed 308 products containing concentrations between 0.000004-2%."
Gluten Ingredients,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",,"Gluten is a protein that occurs naturally in many types of grains, including wheat, rye, and barley. As a general group, gluten ingredients include several grains or grain-derived ingredients that are potentially problematic for those diagnosed with a health condition that interferes with the normal digestion of glutens. In this instance, eating gluten-containing foods is ill-advised. The question is whether those with such a health condition or dietary sensitivity should avoid gluten ingredients in cosmetics, and the answer is no. That’s because gluten ingredients cannot get past the skin’s uppermost layers and enter the body (specifically, the digestive system) where they can be troublesome for those with a gluten intolerance. Gluten is simply too big to get into the body via topical application. The exception is applying gluten-containing products to lips, as in these instances some amount of ingestion occurs. Therefore, you’d want to avoid lip balm, gloss, or lipstick/lip color products that contain gluten ingredients. Of course, if you have an allergy to gluten ingredients you’d want to check with your health care provider to determine if the allergy is limited to oral consumption or also includes topical application (assuming you haven’t already determined that topical application of gluten ingredients is a problem for you). If you have a known sensitivity to gluten, avoid products that contain wheat and its derivatives, malt, barley, rye, wheat germ, and oat ingredients."

Hydrolyzed Collagen,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant","Collagen that’s been broken down into smaller segments | Increases skin’s moisture levels | Promotes a dewy, smooth appearance | Also commonly used in supplements","Hydrolyzed collagen, also referred to as collagen peptides, is collagen that’s been broken down into short chains of amino acids, forming collagen peptides. A major source of collagen is fish skin, which is then reduced to smaller segments. More recently, many different collages pieces have been synthesized in the laboratory. Contrary to popular belief, hydrolyzed collagen does not function as an anti-aging ingredient, but rather a humectant that assists in hydrating skin. Humectants help promote a smooth, plump and dewy appearance by drawing and binding moisture to the skin. They work particularly well when paired with emollients, which help trap moisture within the skin. Collagen occurs naturally in the body. There are many different types of collagen found in the skin which participate in different functions. Alongside elastin, it provides structure and firmness to skin, helping skin maintain a youthful, tight appearance. As we age, our body slows production of collagen and elastin. Combined with accumulated environmental damage, mostly from UV light exposure, this results in sagging skin with a compromised, fragmented structure. Hydrolyzed collagen’s molecules are far too large to penetrate skin and impact its structure. This is why we use collagen-stimulating ingredients, like retinol and vitamin C, in anti-aging skin care. This ingredient’s also commonly used in supplements and hair care. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel assessed hydrolyzed collagen and stated that it’s safe for use in cosmetics. In skin and hair care, usage levels of hydrolyzed collagen typically range from 0.2–2%."

Hydrolyzed Egg Shell Membrane,Good,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Humectant",Derived from the membrane lining egg shells | Rich source of glycosaminoglycans and amino acids | Delivers hydration and potential anti-aging effects | Offers benefit in topical and oral supplement form,"Hydrolyzed egg shell membrane is primarily known for its hydration-enhancing (humectant) properties in skin care formulations; however, emerging research indicates its benefits may extend beyond moisture retention. What is hydrolyzed egg shell membrane? Derived from the thin membrane lining the inside of an egg shell, this ingredient undergoes hydrolysis to become water-soluble. Of note, hydrolyzed egg shell membrane is known to be a rich source of glycosaminoglycans and amino acids, which play a role in replenishing and restoring skin to a healthier state. In the realm of anti-aging, studies have shown hydrolyzed egg shell membrane helps support elastin and collagen and hence, has value as an anti-wrinkle agent. (Its effectiveness in this regard is considered mild but measurable.) Recent studies suggest that oral supplementation of hydrolyzed egg shell membrane may also contribute to skin improvements such as visible reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. As a part of sustainable production practices, suppliers of this ingredient often tout repurposing upcycled egg shells from the food industry. Note: Hydrolyzed egg shell membrane may also be spelled hydrolyzed eggshell membrane."
Hydrolyzed Elastin,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant","Elastin that’s been separated into amino acids through hydrolysis | Serves as a humectant, attracting water to skin | Promotes a soft, hydrated appearance | Safe for use in cosmetics","Hydrolyzed elastin is elastin that’s been broken down into amino acids through the process of hydrolysis. In skin care, hydrolyzed elastin’s humectant properties are used to help hydrate skin through the attraction of moisture to skin’s surface. Elastin’s naturally occurring in the body, working hand-in-hand with collagen to promote a firm, tight appearance. Elastin’s true talent comes in the form of physical resiliency, allowing skin to “bounce back” like elastic after stretching. Although hydrolyzed elastin is derived from elastin protein, it cannot function like elastin does within the body, as its molecules are far too large to penetrate beyond skin’s surface when applied topically. Unlike collagen, it’s much harder to stimulate the regeneration of elastin within the extracellular matrix (area of skin between the epidermis and dermis). That’s why it’s important to maintain the health of the elastin already present in skin through the consistent usage of sun safe practices, such as the application of a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every day. Hydrolyzed elastin is usually sourced from the skin of fish, which is why it can also be referred to as “marine elastin.” The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reviewed hydrolyzed elastin and deemed it safe for use in cosmetics. Typical usage levels for hydrolyzed elastin range from 1–5%."
Hydrolyzed Extensin,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Plant Extracts",Plant-derived protein rich in amino acids | Exhibits hydrating properties | Reduces transepidermal water loss | Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed safe for use in cosmetics,"Hydrolyzed extensin is a hair- and skin-conditioning ingredient used in cosmetics. It’s a plant-based derivative of extensin, hydroxyproline-rich structural glycoproteins that are found in plants’ cell walls, that’s broken down into smaller molecules through the process of hydrolysis. When applied to skin, hydrolyzed extensin exhibits conditioning and hydrating properties through a reduction in transepidermal water loss. Currently, there’s limited research on hydrolyzed extensin’s skin benefits. Extensin is abundant in its amino acid and polysaccharide content; however, its star compound is the amino acid hydroxyproline, which is found in mammalian collagen. Hydrolyzed extensin is commonly sourced from carrots, so it’s been coined “carrot collagen,” and sometimes is referred to as “vegetable collagen.” (Note: there are many other plant-based ingredients that are also referred to as “vegetable collagen”). The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reports usage of hydrolyzed extensin in cosmetics in amounts between 0.01-0.13%. These usage levels were deemed safe for use in cosmetics."
Hydrolyzed Ginseng Saponins,Good,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Antioxidant, Emollient, Plant Extracts",Saponins from ginseng that have gone through hydrolysis | Have antioxidant properties | Primarily used as a skin conditioning ingredient,"Hydrolyzed ginseng saponins are the saponins (a type of sugar-bound compound found in a wide range of plant species) from the Panax ginseng plant that have gone through a chemical change through exposure to enzymes, acids, or water. Although hydrolyzed ginseng saponins have antioxidant properties, their primary value in leave-on cosmetics is an emollient skin-conditioning ingredient. At the time of this writing, the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review has investigated the safety of hydrolyzed ginseng saponins as used in cosmetics, but at the time of its review, they were not in wide enough usage to get verifiable data. The sole cosmetic supplier of this ingredient lists its use level as “unlimited”, which is unusual and most likely ill-advised until we have more robust safety data."

Hydrolyzed Pea Protein,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Emulsifier, Plant Extracts",Emollient and hair conditioning agent | Also functions as a surfactant | Considered one of the more environmentally friendly surfactants | Ruled safe as used in cosmetics,"Hydrolyzed pea protein is a natural emollient and hair conditioning agent in cosmetics. As the name suggests, it’s a product produced when protein extracted from peas is hydrolyzed, meaning that it has gone through a transformation breakdown using enzymes or water. In addition to serving as an emollient, hydrolyzed pea protein also functions as a surfactant, meaning it captures dirt and permits it to be rinsed from skin. Because of its plant-based origins, hydrolyzed pea protein is considered one of the more environmentally friendly forms of surfactants used in cosmetics. Hydrolyzed pea protein has been ruled safe in its current usage in hair and skin care. When used on its own, the typical concentration is 0.5–1.5%, depending on formulary needs."

Hydrolyzed Vegetable Protein,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Plant Extracts","Plant-derived hydrating ingredient | Promotes water-binding and skin conditioning | Contains skin-friendly amino acids, peptides and proteins | Also used in the food and hair care industries","Hydrolyzed vegetable protein is a skin conditioning, water-binding ingredient used in formulas to help promote balanced hydration. Like its name implies, it’s vegetable derived (potatoes, corn, soy, legume, peas, etc.) and made up of skin-friendly amino acids, proteins and peptides. To create this ingredient, vegetable proteins must undergo hydrolysis via acid or enzyme which breaks them down into smaller “pieces.” The result? Made-for-skin (or food- these ingredients are also used in the food industry) vegetable-derived amino acids and peptides that improve hydration and help smooth the look of skin through moisture-related plumpness. Hydrolyzed vegetable protein isn’t the same thing as vegetable collagen. Vegetable collagen is a colloquial term used by ingredient suppliers to refer to blends of plant-derived, collagen-like ingredients. The ingredients that make up vegetable collagen blends vary from brand-to-brand. Hydrolyzed vegetable protein is a verified INCI name and ingredient. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reviewed hydrolyzed vegetable protein and deemed it as safe for use in cosmetics at current concentration levels (0.0%-0.0025%). Hydrolyzed vegetable protein is also used in hair care where it can help hydrate, strengthen and provide anti-static benefits."

Hydroxyapatite,Good,,Texture Enhancer,Used to deliver bio-active ingredients in a controlled manner | Considered bio-compatible and breaks down to calcium | Helps enhance texture | Can be used as an abrasive agent | Safe micro-sized versions typically used in cosmetics,"Hydroxyapatite is a texture- and delivery-enhancing ingredient typically derived from the mineral calcium. It is used to encapsulate and deliver bio-active ingredients to skin in a controlled manner. This benefit extends the efficacy timeframe while reducing the risk of a sensitized response. Hydroxyapatite’s advantages as a carrier for other ingredients are its bio-compatibility with skin and biodegradability within skin’s uppermost layers, allowing the calcium shell to release its contents and then skin utilizes the calcium for normal maintenance. Hydroxyapatite is sometimes used in cosmetics to add bulk or as an abrasive agent, such as scrubs. Use levels of this ingredient in cosmetics vary based on its role. This ingredient is also used in oral care products, such as toothpastes, and is considered safe, including in dental care products meant for use by children. Note: There’s some concern about nano-sized versions of this ingredient as typically used in certain types of dermal fillers and surgical repair of bones. The research in this regard points to hydroxyapatite’s safety, but it’s not conclusive. The type of hydroxyapatite used in cosmetics is typically micro-sized, which isn’t nearly as small as nano-sized, and unable to penetrate past skin’s uppermost (epidermal) layers. Think of it in this application as a soft shell which slowly breaks down to release its beneficial contents."
Hydroxyethyl Acrylate/Sodium Acryloyldimethyl Taurate Copolymer,Good,,"Suspending/Dispersing Agent, Texture Enhancer, Polymer",Versatile polymer widely used in skin care and makeup | Aids texture and helps stabilize formulas | Used as a thickening agent in water-based products | Often used to create aesthetically pleasing transformative textures | Helps disperse skin-beneficial ingredients such as UV filters,"Hydroxyethyl acrylate/sodium acryloyldimethyl taurate copolymer is a synthetic polymer that has many uses in cosmetics: it primarily functions as a stabilizer, texture enhancer, dispersing agent, and opacifier. It is often combined with ingredients such as isohexadecane, various polysorbates, and a blend of dimethicone- or siloxane-based silicones. These combinations give a cosmetics chemist several options to create appealing aesthetics. Unlike other thickeners, when available in a liquid mixture it allows the formulator to adjust the viscosity of the formula at the end of the process. The copolymer plays a role in how fast a product “breaks” on skin (meaning how quickly its initial texture changes once applied). For this reason, it’s often used in products with transformative, gel-cream textures. Another helpful aspect of this copolymer is that it can be used within a wide pH range without its efficacy or stability changing. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review has deemed this ingredient safe as used in cosmetics. Concentration maximums include 4.3% in rinse-off products and up to 3.6% in leave-on products, including eyeliners and eyeshadows. Cosmetic brands typically use less than those maximum amounts since the safety assessment of this ingredient capped its usage at 3% in leave-on products."

It belongs to the chemical class carbohydrates and is used in all types of personal care products, including conditioners, facial care, body washes, sunscreens, and hairstyling products. This ingredient is also used to stabilize cosmetic products and may be listed as distarch phosphate or hydroxypropyl distarch phosphate."
Hydroxypropyl Tetrahydropyrantriol,Good,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Humectant",Derived from xylose (a sugar abundant in beech trees) | Used in skin care products for its purported anti-aging and hydrating properties | May help increase glycosaminoglycans within skin | Also known as Pro-Xylane,"Hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol (also known as Pro-Xylane or HTP) is used in skin care products for its purported anti-aging and hydrating properties. It is a sugar-protein hybrid derived from xylose (a sugar abundant in beech trees) and is typically produced through a chemical modification process that enhances its stability. This cosmetic ingredient was developed by L’Oreal, and as such, studies related to its efficacy tend to have conflicts of interest due to their ties to L’Oreal brands. This does not mean that hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol can’t be effective for skin—it’s just something to keep in mind in terms of potential research bias. Of note, the Research Group of L’Oréal claims hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol helps support glycosaminoglycans within skin. Glycosaminoglycans are a fundamental component of skin tissue that play an integral role in skin’s natural ability to retain water (aka hydration). Another study suggests hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol is beneficial for post-menopausal skin as it improves the quantitative composition of sebum and epidermal lipids that are typically depleted during this phase of life. This study also indicates hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol may play a role in improving skin’s barrier strength. Other potential benefits of hydroxypropyl tetrahydropyrantriol as claimed by its suppliers include pro-collagen and anti-wrinkle effects when used in concentrations between 2-5%. At the time of this writing, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has not analyzed this ingredient’s safety profile but there does not appear to be any concerns."
Hydroxystearic Acid,Good,,"Emollient, Texture Enhancer, Cleansing Agent",May be derived from castor oil or created in a lab | Also known as octadecanoic acid and 12-hydroxystearic acid | Considered a surfactant when used in soaps | Considered a hydrating fatty acid when used in leave-on products,"Hydroxystearic acid is a fatty acid-based ingredient that has much versatility. It can work in cleansing formulas as a surfactant while adding emollient and texture-enhancing properties to products such as moisturizers, makeup, and sunscreens. The natural form derived from castor oil is used most, but hydroxystearic acid can also be made synthetically. It is chemically similar to stearic acid, another fatty acid used in thousands of skin care, makeup, and hair care products since it is non-irritating and works well in many types of formulas. Emerging research from a supplier of an oleic acid-derived form of hydroxystearic acid shows it may play a role in reducing pore size and fading discolorations; however, independent research is needed to verify such claims. Research from Unilever shows it works to help offset hyperpigmentation triggered by exposure to airborne pollutants, possibly due to its antioxidant ability which prevented the oxidation of lipids (fats) in skin that would normally occur when exposed to such pollutants. Hydroxystearic acid is considered safe as used in cosmetics at concentrations of 10% or less. The typical usage level for this ingredient is 1-5%."
Hylocereus Undatus Fruit Extract,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","Antioxidant-rich plant-extract derived from the Hylocereus undatus fruit, AKA pitaya or white dragon fruit | Assists in protecting skin from pro-aging environmental stressors | Helps skin maintain a youthful glow | Susceptible to degradation when exposed to light and air","Hylocereus undatus fruit extract, also known as pitaya or white dragon fruit extract, is a plant-derived antioxidant that works to neutralize the impact of pro-aging external aggressors. Through helping to renew skin’s protection against agents which can exacerbate the look of fine lines, wrinkles and uneven skin tone, this plant extract helps skin appear youthful and healthy. Hylocereus undatus fruit extract receives most of its antioxidant properties from flavonoids, compounds synthesized by plants during their own metabolic processes. A nutritional analysis of white dragon fruit also revealed that the fruit’s flesh contains gallic and caffeic acids, phenolic compounds that also help protect skin from external aggressors. Usage levels of Hylocereus undatus range from 0.5–2%. It is almost always supplied as part of a blend with ingredients such as glycerin and one or more preservatives. Much like with other ingredients that contain plant-derived antioxidants, Hylocereus undatus is sensitive to degradation when exposed to light and air. Due to this susceptibility, this plant extract should be housed in air- and light-protective packaging so that it maintains its benefits for skin."
Hypochlorous Acid,Good,"Smooths Bumpy Skin, Soothing","Smooths Bumpy Skin, Soothing, Antibacterial",Naturally occurring oxidizing ingredient | Helps tackle harmful microorganisms on skin & surfaces | Promotes a smooth appearance | Can help calm irritated or sensitized skin,"Hypochlorous acid is a multi-purpose skin care ingredient that can help reduce harmful substances, like bacteria, on skin that can go on to cause redness and breakouts. It also has anti-fungal and germicidal properties that make it an interesting option for reducing common pathogens on skin and surfaces. The body naturally makes hypochlorous acid, where it serves as part of a fierce system of defense against harmful microorganisms that can cause illness and infection. It’s for this reason that hypochlorous acid is often tapped as a disinfectant in medical settings. When applied to skin, in-vitro and in-vivo studies demonstrate that hypochlorous acid can help promote a smooth texture, reduce the appearance of breakouts, soothe irritated and reddened skin, help reduce the health impact of various illness-causing pathogens, and help assist in skin recovery. Promising studies show that hypochlorous acid, when used in a superoxidized solution, might be on par with the breakout-busting ingredient benzoyl peroxide, but more research needs to be completed before boldly making that claim. This ingredient is highly sensitive to pH levels and overall product formula stability. Formulas that contain hypochlorous acid should have a pH between 3.5-5.5. The hypochlorous acid used in skin care formulas is synthetically created. It’s an active component of bleach, however it is not harmful to skin (remember, our body naturally makes it). Your nose may make this association since hypochlorous acid’s scent is reminiscent of bleach, albeit not as intense."
Hyssop,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",,"Agastache mexicana (also known as hyssop) is a flowering shrub native to North America that’s an edible plant with an anise-like flavor and aroma. The flower, leaf, and stem are sources of antioxidants, including hesperetin, apigenin, salvigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin. Research on this plant’s direct benefit to skin is somewhat lacking; however, its antioxidant and calming abilities means it complements the benefits of more proven antioxidants."
Illite,Good,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Absorbent, Texture Enhancer",,"Illite is a mineral-sourced natural thickener that also has good absorbent properties and is sometimes referred to as French green clay.   Illite has a stronger ability to calm skin irritated by influencing factors in skin that can lead to health issues. Interestingly, it's not as absorbent as many other clays (kaolin being one) which is why it's rarely used as the sole absorbent ingredient in products for oily or blemish-prone skin."
Inactive Ingredient,Good,,"Occlusive/Opacifying Agent, Polymer, Texture Enhancer","Provides support for active ingredients in a skin care formula | Plays crucial formulary roles, which may include adjusting the pH, stabilizing the emulsion, etc. | May deliver hydration, antioxidant power, exfoliating abilities, skin-softening, etc. | Listed after the active ingredient(s) in alphabetical or descending order","Inactive ingredients provide support for active drug ingredients in a skin care formula and lend cosmetic benefits. These are indicated on a product’s ingredient list and may also be identified as “other” instead of “inactive”—another way of signaling they are not directly responsible for the pharmacological activity or other direct effects of the formula to the structure or function of skin. Active ingredients are listed with their concentration and a short description of their function. The inactive ingredients are listed after the active ingredients, typically in descending order of concentration (although there are some exceptions to this rule). Inactive ingredients really aren’t “inactive” per se, as they play a variety of important roles in skin care formulas. They can deliver hydration, antioxidant power, exfoliating abilities, skin-softening, soothing properties, brightening, etc. They also play formulary roles in adjusting the pH, stabilizing the emulsion, emulsifying, adding cleansing properties, intensifying the opacity, or adjusting the viscosity… and so on and so on. Note: Outside of the U.S., definitions of active and inactive ingredients may vary by each country’s regulatory criteria."

This plant- or synthetic-based texture-enhancing ingredient feels velvety-soft and is used to help keep pigments dispersed in makeup products such as foundations. It also enhances the spreadability of skin care products and can be found in hair conditioners. Isoamyl laurate is sometimes touted as a natural alternative to silicones, thanks to its lightweight, smoothing sensation. (But for the record, silicones are perfectly fine skin care ingredients, so you don’t need to avoid them.) As a raw material, isoamyl laurate is described as having an oily liquid appearance. According to the 2015 Cosmetic Ingredient Review assessment of isoamyl laurate, this ingredient was deemed safe in current cosmetic practices of use up (when formulated to be nonirritating). Paula’s Choice Skincare uses the plant-derived, 100% natural form of this ingredient."
Isobutyl Acetate,Good,,Solvent,,"Isobutyl acetate is a solvent used to dissolve or break down other ingredients, such as gases or solids, to form a solution."
Isobutylparaben,Good,,Preservative,,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help."

It has silicone-like aesthetics and is used for a wide variety of purposes in cosmetics, including as an emollient. In addition, it leaves a dry, silky finish and can help deliver oil-soluble ingredients in to skin’s uppermost layers. Isodecyl neopentanoate also works to modify the rheology of cosmetic formulas, which is a fancy way to say it can positively impact a product’s flow, such as how quickly a sunscreen or shampoo is dispensed (does it flow freely or do you really have to work to get product out?). Usage levels of isodecyl neopentanoate in cosmetics ranges from 5–10%, although amounts lower than this may be present when this ingredient is part of a blend. It has been evaluated and deemed safe as used in cosmetics, assuming such products are formulated to be non-irritating."

It is particularly popular in facial masks targeted at reducing skin’s surface oil. While its absorbent properties are helpful for those with oily skin, it can be drying for other skin types (especially if used in very high amounts). To avoid this issue, some formulators pair kaolin with hydrating/soothing ingredients which work to offset some of its absorbency so skin benefits without feeling dry or tight. Kaolin’s other reported cosmetic functions include as an anticaking agent, bulking agent, and opacifying agent. Depending on how it’s supplied and what it’s formulated with, kaolin can also function as an abrasive agent. As a raw material, kaolin is a soft, white clay comprised predominantly of kaolinite, a hydrated aluminum silicate. According to the Personal Care Council, “Kaolin is extracted from kaolinized granite by washing it out with powerful and remote water hoses. The clay stream is then pumped to the separation plant where sand and mica are removed. The purified clay is filtered when wet and then dried. The very fine powder is formed by milling.” Purified kaolin has a long history of safe use in cosmetics. Further supporting its safety, kaolin has been generally recognized as safe (also known as GRAS status) by the US FDA as a direct food additive. Kaolin is also sometimes referred to as “China Clay.”"

In vitro and in vivo research and animal studies have shown that kojic acid is effective for brightening an uneven skin tone. Kojic acid is typically used at concentrations between 0.1 to 2.0% but has been used in some products up to 4.0%. In 2010 the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel concluded that kojic acid is safe for use in cosmetic products up to a concentration of 1%. It functions as a skin brightener by inhibiting the formation of melanin by inhibiting the enzyme tyrosinase. Kojic acid’s downside is that it’s an unstable ingredient in cosmetic formulations. On exposure to air or sunlight, it turns brown and loses its efficacy. Many cosmetics companies use kojic dipalmitate as an alternative because it’s more stable in formulations.

Its main benefits relate to light enzyme-induced exfoliation and its antioxidant properties. According to suppliers of this ingredient, the fermentation of Punica granatum fruit extract reduces the ingredient’s molecule size, allowing for better skin penetration. This process also allows for the enzymatic and antioxidant compounds within plant extracts to become more available to skin, making their benefits more pronounced. Lactobacillus_/_Punica granatum fruit ferment extract contains ellagitannins, including punicalagin, and flavonoids which deliver antioxidant benefits. Beyond helping mitigate the damage that external aggressors, like UV rays and pollution, can inflict upon skin, this extract also helps to reduce the look of wrinkles and fine lines as well as boost the health of skin’s firming architecture. Punicalagin, the stand-out ellagitannin in pomegranate, assists in evening skin tone and reducing the look of discolorations. Protease is where Lactobacillus_/_Punica granatum fruit ferment extract’s exfoliation properties come into play. This enzyme triggers proteolysis, or the breakdown of proteins which allows for the upper-most dead, dull layer of skin to slough off, revealing the newer, healthier skin beneath.

It has long been burdened with a reputation for being a sensitizing agent, which has always been a disappointment to formulators because lanolin is such an effective moisturizing ingredient. A study in the British Journal of Dermatology concluded “that lanolin sensitization has remained at a relatively low and constant rate even in a high-risk population.” Based on a review of 24,449 patients who were tested with varying forms of lanolin, it turned out that “The mean annual rate of sensitivity was 1.7% - and it was lower than that for a 50% concentration of lanolin. The amounts of lanolin used in products like facial and body moisturizers are much less than this, so the risk, if any, is negligible. Lanolin is a very good ingredient for someone with dry skin, though it can be a problem for someone with oily or breakout-prone skin. Also, as an animal-derived ingredient, lanolin is sometimes viewed as less favorable in comparison to synthetic or plant-derived alternatives."

Malachite Extract,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant","Extract of malachite, a copper-rich mineral | Copper’s integral to skin and body health | Helps curb the impact of environmental stressors | Promotes a youthful appearance","Malachite extract comes from malachite, a mineral rich in copper. In cosmetics, malachite functions as an antioxidant, assisting in protecting skin from environmental stressors. Copper’s a critical mineral that assists in numerous processes that keep the human body functioning. This mineral is present in superoxide dismutase, a powerful enzymatic antioxidant which occurs naturally in the body. When applied topically to skin, copper helps improve skin health; however, it interacts negatively with vitamin C, so its combined use should be avoided. As an aside, keep in mind that if you want to see what copper can do for your skin, it’s better to use products that contain a direct form of it, such as copper PCA, rather than malachite extract since its copper content varies. The malachite extraction process consists of first grinding down the mineral into a fine powder and then increasing its solubility. Finally, the extract is neutralized. Malachite extract should not be confused with malachite green, a dye used in a myriad of applications; however, the extract can impart a soft blue hue to cosmetics when used at levels of 1% or greater. Recommended usage level of malachite extract in skin care is 1–5%."

Maltose,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant","A plant-derived sugar that consists of two glucose molecules | Hydrates via retention of moisture | Functions as a skin conditioning ingredient | Also known as maltobiose or malt sugar | Has skin, medical, and food applications","Maltose, also known as maltobiose or malt sugar, is a natural sugar that’s often derived from malt, or germinated cereal grain. As a sugar, it’s a disaccharide that’s composed of two glucose molecules bonded together. This disaccharide has food, health and skin care applications. When used in skin care, maltose serves as a humectant and skin conditioning ingredient, helping the skin to retain moisture, ultimately aiding in skin hydration. In food applications, maltose is used as a sweetener. In health applications, maltose serves as a material used to make dissolvable microneedles that deliver substances to skin. In recent studies, maltose was used to create microneedles that delivered retinal and adenosine to the skin in anti-aging procedures. Research has also suggested that hydrolysable sugars, such as maltose, when combined with anti-hyperglycemic agents can help fade hyperpigmentation and improve uneven skin tone when taken orally. Maltose is safe for use in cosmetics in concentrations between .3 and .5% per the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel."

Matricaria Oil,Good,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","Has antioxidant benefits | Also has soothing and antibacterial properties | Deemed safe as used in cosmetics | Commercial oil usually comes from the Chamomilla recutita, or German chamomile, plant","Matricaria oil is oil extracted from a genus of flowering plants known as Matricaria . Most of this oil used in cosmetics specifically comes from the Chamomilla recutita plant, also known as German chamomile. Studies demonstrate matricaria oil has – as with many plant-derived oils – a wealth of antioxidant benefits. Further research demonstrates it also has soothing properties, along with antibacterial compounds that make it a popular addition in many skin care products. Naturally bluish green to green in color, since the use levels of this oil are so low (between 0.00001-0.29%) it typically does not impart a noticeable color to skin care products despite still being efficacious in these amounts. Note that as with all plant oils, routine exposure to air and light will cause the oil to oxidize and discolor (it will turn brown). Do not purchase products with this ingredient that are packaged in clear or jar containers. Matricaria oil is considered safe as used in cosmetics. Irritation tests using a 4% concentration of the oil—much greater than what’s typically used in cosmetics—was shown to be non-irritating and non-sensitizing after a 48-hour occluded patch test."

Methylparaben,Good,,Preservative,,"Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skincare products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help."

In a skin care formula, it can enhance the absorption of ingredients such as salicylic acid for better penetration and efficacy. Methylpropanediol also has pronounced hydrating properties that can leave a smooth, dewy finish on skin. It is sometimes used as part of preservative blend where it helps boost the effectiveness of preservatives, so a lower amount of them is necessary. In fragrance formulations, methylpropanediol can prolong scent intensity on the skin. As a raw material it is clear, colorless liquid. During their evaluation in June 2018, the panel of experts for the Cosmetic Ingredient Review council recognized methylpropanediol as a safe ingredient as traditionally used in cosmetic in products."

Mica,Good,,"Coloring Agent/Pigment, Texture Enhancer, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent",General term for a group of 37 earth-derived silicate minerals | Often included in cosmetic formulations to impart iridescent or opalescent shine | May also be used to impart varying degrees of opacity | Light-reflective quality makes it highly desirable for giving skin a healthy-looking glow | Mica is considered safe and can be ethically sourced through the Responsible Mica Initiative,"Mica is the general term given for a group of 37 earth-derived silicate minerals that are often included in cosmetic formulations to impart sparkle in the form of an iridescent or opalescent shine. The amount and look of the shine depend on the exact mineral itself, how finely it’s milled for use in liquid, cream, or powder products, and how much is added to a given formula. Mica can also be used to impart varying degrees of opacity. Mica’s light-reflective quality makes it highly desirable for giving skin a healthy-looking glow and can even be used to brighten a shadowy under-eye area. Hues of mica cover a wide spectrum of the rainbow, though in cosmetics it is typically used in its pearlescent white form. It is often coated in titanium dioxide, which maximizes the color resulting from iridescence. Mica is considered safe for use in cosmetics, including those applied to the eyes and lips. Its usage concentration range is wide, going from 1% or less (depending on desired result) to upwards of 60%, although even higher concentrations are permitted. Mica can also be synthetically manufactured. In this form it is often referred to as synthetic fluorphlogopite mica or artificial mica—and takes on a different role as a bulking agent to thicken emulsions. In recent years, controversial child labor practices around mining mica have been exposed. For ethical sourcing, companies can choose suppliers who are members of the Responsible Mica Initiative (RMI). Paula’s Choice only uses suppliers of mica who are RMI affiliated."

It is defined as the isolated, colloidal crystalline portion of cellulose fibers, which can be plant derived or created synthetically. In certain instances, microcrystalline cellulose is considered an “upcycled ingredient” because it can be created as a by-product of the waste from agricultural industries, including banana, corn, sugarcane, and soybean farming. It can also be extracted from oil palm fibers. Researchers also note microcrystalline cellulose offers antioxidant properties and can help improve formulary shelf life. The strength of antioxidant power depends on the source and method of preparation. Microcrystalline cellulose has been deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review, with reported concentrations of use ranging from 0.0001 to 57%."
Microcrystalline Wax,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Texture Enhancer, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent","Petroleum-derived wax with a crystalline structure | Gummy texture gives it great versatility in cosmetics | Helps bind oils and solvents | Considered safe as used in cosmetics, including lip products","Microcrystalline wax is a petroleum-derived ingredient used for its occlusive, binding and texture-enhancing properties. Although mineral-derived, the processing and purification this wax goes through prior to use in cosmetics makes the result synthetic. Its hydrocarbons (molecules only consisting of hydrogen and carbon) are arranged in a fine crystalline structure, which is where this ingredient gets a portion of its name. Microcrystalline wax’s soft, gummy nature (it’s more flexible than paraffin) gives it high versatility in all kinds of cosmetics, from hairstyling products to moisturizers, lip balms and more. Despite its texture, this wax is still fairly solid and is sometimes used in cosmetics to create semi-solid to solid texture—think hair pomades and thick lip balms. Although microcrystalline wax has a low oil content, it can help bind other oils as well as solvents when blended in cosmetics, creating improved and consistent product textures. It’s typically supplied in slab form but may also be blended with other emollients and waxes supplied in liquid form. Use levels of microcrystalline wax in cosmetics was not available as this entry was being written.

Carboxylic acids have a wide variety of uses in cosmetics, from smoothing and softening skin to easing redness and providing antimicrobial properties that help keep a cosmetic safe from contaminants. Back to octadecenedioic acid, which is often referred to the scientific research as 9-octadecenedioic acid: it’s plant-derived (from olives) and studies show it plays a novel role in interrupting excess melanin via binding to enzymatic receptor sites on skin’s surface that help encourage normal, even skin color. The recommended usage level for octadecenedioic acid in skin care with the goal of improving dark spots is 2%. Although this is a promising ingredient, it’s rarely used in cosmetics; however, it’s not known to be problematic for skin."

Transesterification is an eco-friendly chemical conversion where fatty acids such as triglycerides react with alcohol and other esters to form a new compound that is water soluble despite being made from an oil. In skin care products, olive oil PEG-7 esters works as an emollient, emulsifier, and mild, secondary cleansing agent (”secondary” meaning it assists the primary cleansing agent which precedes it on the ingredient list). This ingredient can also be used as solubilizing agent for essential oils and fragrance ingredients. Olive oil PEG-7 esters has been deemed safe as used in cosmetics by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel. Their 2014 assessment looked at maximum use concentration ranges for olive oil PEG-7 esters up to 12% for leave-on products and 97% rinse-off formulations."
Oxybenzone,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, UV Filters","Globally approved UV filter | Offers both UVA and UVB protection | Has weak estrogenic properties that do not pose a health risk | Not definitively proven to damage corals in real-world settings | Despite claims to the contrary, it’s unlikely to irritate skin when used in approved amounts","Oxybenzone is a globally approved sunscreen agent that protects primarily from UVB rays, and some, but not all, UVA rays. The maximum amount of oxybenzone approved for use in sunscreens varies by country: the United States and Canada permit concentrations up to 6%; Australia, New Zealand, European Union countries and most countries in Asia allow up to 10% except Japan which caps it at 5%. Studies in people and animals have shown oxybenzone has an estrogenic effect; however, this activity is considered weak, and some studies have shown no such effect. In cases where a hormonal change was measured via topical application, the difference was one million-fold less than what was measured from normal hormonal activity in the body. Studies involving people have shown that common UV filters do not have a biologically significant effect on hormones. Moreover, the small amount of this ingredient capable of getting into the body via topical application is metabolized and excreted, just like similar water-soluble ingredients. Research on pregnant people using sunscreens with 6% oxybenzone has shown that enough of it can penetrate the skin, enter the body, and can cross the placental barrier. But just because fetal exposure to oxybenzone in sunscreen is possible does not mean any harm is being done; oxybenzone has never been shown to cause any type of birth defect. Interestingly, some studies have shown that oxybenzone itself isn’t to blame, but instead a metabolite (4-hydroxy-benzophenone) of this ingredient is the issue. This metabolite comes from benzophenone, a chemical used in pharmaceuticals, recycled paper, inks, furniture, paints, lacquers, even as a flavoring in candy. In essence, it’s impossible to avoid any exposure to these ingredients, but you can certainly opt to avoid sunscreens that contain oxybenzone. Oxybenzone is sometimes called out as a sunscreen active that is damaging to undersea coral reefs, the theory being that the sunscreen gets into the water from human activity in the oceans. However, despite research showing oxybenzone negatively impacts coral in vitro (meaning in a lab setting), there isn’t conclusive causation in a marine environment, especially given the numerous other factors, including climate change and ocean acidification believed to be the major causes of coral damage. This sunscreen ingredient is also called out for being a skin irritant; however, research examining widespread use of sunscreens containing oxybenzone hasn’t shown this to be the case. But as with all synthetic UV filters, a sensitized or allergic reaction is possible. Based on recent research on use of oxybenzone, it is one of several UV filters currently undergoing further safety testing under the purview of the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This testing is to gain a better understanding of the systemic absorption, metabolism, and elimination of these sunscreen actives when small amounts enter the body via topical use. It’s important to know that the presence of this or other sunscreen actives in the body does not mean your health is at risk. It is anticipated that the additional testing being done will reaffirm the safety of these ingredients; however, those who remain concerned can choose sunscreens with mineral actives (titanium dioxide and zinc oxide) which are not included in the FDA’s new call for additional testing."

It is the most common fatty acid found in animals, plants, and microorganisms. It is used as the basis for many palmitate ingredients, such as isopropyl palmitate. Palmitic acid has many functions in cosmetics, such as a detergent cleansing agent and an emollient. In a cleanser, it has the potential to be drying depending on which other ingredients it’s combined with and the cleanser’s pH level. In moisturizers, palmitic acid is a very good emollient while its emulsifying abilities help keep unlike ingredients from separating. Palmitic acid has been determined safe as used in cosmetics when used in concentrations up to 13%."

Parabens,Good,,Preservative,"Group of controversial preservatives | Includes butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben and ethylparaben | In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin","Parabens are a group of controversial preservatives that include butylparaben, isobutylparaben, propylparaben, methylparaben and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plant’s own protection. For many years parabens were ubiquitous and found in most topical cosmetic products as part of a broad-spectrum preservative system. Over the past 20 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skin care products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or that they are found naturally in plants, so either source could have been the origin, not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects, but those were done in vitro (meaning in a petri dish) or, again, they were animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help."
Paraffin,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Texture Enhancer, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent","Saturated white wax derived from petroleum | Highly purified for use in cosmetics | Emollient properties soften, smooth + help protect skin | Helps prevent dry, cracked lips | Considered safe as used in cosmetics","Paraffin is a type of white wax that helps smooth and soften skin as well as provide occlusive properties. It forms a flexible film on skin that prevents moisture loss, which is why you’ll see it in many products meant for dry skin and dry, chapped lips. Derived from petroleum and highly purified for use in cosmetics, paraffin is supplied as a solid (saturated) mixture of hydrocarbons, which are chemicals made up of only hydrogen and carbon (hence, “hydrocarbon”). A broad range of cosmetic ingredients are hydrocarbons, including the alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, natural waxes such as beeswax and plant oils such as those from palm, sunflower and coconut. In no way are any of these dangerous or bad ingredients for skin. Although its starting point is natural, paraffin is considered synthetic due to the processing it undergoes prior to its use in cosmetics. Paraffin is available with various melting points, so formulators can choose the degree to which this happens, a decision that impacts a cosmetic’s texture, spread and wear. Paraffin is considered safe and non-toxic as used in cosmetics, including products such as those for lips where some ingestion is possible. This ingredient has an extraordinarily wide use range, from 0.001%–90% depending on the type of product and its intended purpose. Note: newer research has shown that paraffin isn’t good at restoring skin’s barrier, which makes sense given it sits on skin’s surface due to its large size and, unlike ceramides and cholesterol, isn’t naturally found in skin. Other research on hand eczema has shown paraffin baths (extremely dry hands dipped in warm liquid paraffin) produced a significant improvement in dryness compared with placebo."

As such, it increases water content (hydration) in the uppermost layers of skin. It is also part of skin’s intercellular matrix and plays an influential role in what’s known as skin’s natural moisturizing factor. This makes PCA a skin care ingredient that skin readily recognizes and knows how to utilize. Several mineral-based derivatives of PCA are used in skin care, including sodium PCA, calcium PCA, magnesium PCA, and potassium PCA. Linking these mineral electrolytes with PCA allows them to work within skin’s aquaporins (water channels) to enhance hydration and train skin to maintain its moisture balance. This also helps strengthen skin’s barrier. PCA has been deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel. Their report surveyed products containing between 0.000012-1.9% PCA."

PEG,Good,,"Cleansing Agent, Emollient, Emulsifier",,"PEG is an acronym for polyethylene glycol , an amazingly versatile ingredient in skin care products because of the many uses it has and its broad compatibility with different types of ingredients. PEG is often mixed with an array of hydrating emollients, beneficial fatty acids, and cleansing agents. In these various combinations, a PEG can be used in gentle cleansers, elegant moisturizers, sunscreens, and unique treatment products. The safety of PEG in its various forms has recently been questioned. The primary concern is that they can contain problematic impurities such as ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane. Both of these are by-products from the manufacturing process, not something natural to any form of PEG. Although this was once a concern, reputable cosmetic ingredient suppliers have long since eliminated these impurities from the finished ingredient, which makes PEGs safe for skin. What is most notable about the various forms of PEG studied to date is they have been shown to be non-irritating for skin or eyes, even when used in concentrations greater than what most skin care products contain. PEGs also widely considered non-toxic because they do not penetrate intact skin. However, as is true for even the gentlest ingredients, when skin is inflamed or compromised, the risk of irritation is increased. If you’ve seen conflicting information about PEG ingredients, it’s important to know that the conclusions were not applicable to how PEGs are used in skin care products. These studies involved feeding a large amount of PEG to animals or applying very high doses (literally hundreds of magnitudes greater than what is used in topical products) to mouse skin."

It may be animal-derived or synthetic (Paula’s Choice uses the latter). It is commonly used as an emulsifier and mild cleansing agent, where it’s often seen in oil-based formulas due to its ability to help oily ingredients rinse from skin without leaving a greasy residue. It is noted for offering skin-softening properties as well. Some suppliers report this surfactant works very well to cleanse particulate matter (a form of airborne pollutants) from skin. In rinse-off products, such as facial cleansers or body washes, PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate is used up to 20% concentration. For leave-on formulations, such as moisturizers and sunscreens, it typically tops out at 5%. This ingredient has undergone extensive toxicology review and is considered non-irritating and safe as used in rinse-off or leave-on cosmetics. PEG-20 glyceryl triisostearate’s high molecular weight keeps it from penetrating past skin’s surface."

PEG-4,Good,,Humectant,Type of polyethylene glycol | Used as a humectant and solvent in cosmetics | Ruled safe for use in skin care | Highest concentration (20%) is used in manicure preparations,"PEG-4 is a polyethylene glycol used as a lightweight humectant (an ingredient which attracts and holds moisture to skin) and solvent in skin care products. The safety of PEG in its various forms has recently been questioned. The primary concern is that they can contain problematic impurities such as ethylene oxide and 1,4 dioxane. Both are by-products from the manufacturing process, not something natural to any form of PEG. Although this was once a concern, reputable cosmetic ingredient suppliers have long since eliminated these impurities from the finished ingredient, which makes PEGs safe for skin. As for PEG-4 specifically, the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review board has deemed it safe in its current use. The highest concentration included in cosmetics is 20%, in some manicure preparations."

Pentaerythrityl Tetra-Di-T-Butyl Hydroxyhydrocinnamate,Good,,Antioxidant,Synthetic ingredient that works as an antioxidant | Helps ensure consistent efficacy and stability of other antioxidants | Prevents unwanted color changes in cosmetics | Works best in products that contain fats and oils,"Pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate is a synthetic, odorless antioxidant often added to skin care formulas such as sunscreens to ensure consistent efficacy and stability of other, more fragile antioxidants. A little goes a long way: the recommended usage level of pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate is between 0.01-0.1%. The safety assessment of this ingredient looked at concentrations from 0.0001%-0.8% as used in leave-on products. It’s typically used in concentrations of 0.5% or less in rinse-off formulas. Its oil-soluble nature means it pairs best with other oils and fats in a formula. Although it is available and can be used on its own, this antioxidant is commonly used in a blend with other ingredients such as emollient squalane and film-forming polymers as more of a “total package” of stability, texture enhancing, creating stick formulas (as in lipstick and sunscreen sticks), and also serving as an alternative to silicone ingredients. It is frequently used to protect natural oils, fragrances, and butters from oxidation. The high molecular weight of pentaerythrityl tetra-di-t-butyl hydroxyhydrocinnamate does not penetrate past skin’s surface. It is considered safe as used in cosmetics."

It is often referred to as a “neuropeptide” in scientific literature, with “neuro” referring to nerves. Pentapeptide-18 is also noted in research for its ability to hydrate skin and improve firmness. It is commonly referenced in research alongside another neuropeptide known as acetyl hexapeptide-8 (or acetyl hexapeptide-3 or agireline), where it has been reported these ingredients have an additive synergistic effect in visibly reducing wrinkles. Variations of this ingredient exist, based on different sequences of its compounds. One study (funded by Colgate-Palmolive Company and PCA SKIN®) demonstrated that when the amino acid D-tyrosine is added to the pentapeptide-18 configuration, it helps visibly fade dark spots and other forms of uneven tone. More independent studies are necessary to validate these findings, but it does look promising. This peptide is effective in amounts of 0.025% up to 10%, depending on formulary goals and the amount of peptide present in solution or powder forms which vary between suppliers. Suppliers of pentapeptide-18 note that it comes as a white to yellowish powder in its raw material form, but it is also available in an aqueous solution. *There are dozens of different pentapeptides used in skin care products. The “penta” portion of pentapeptide-18 refers to its composition of five amino acids."
Pentapeptide-34 trifluoroacetate,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Peptides",Synthetic peptide said to help boost skin’s coenzyme Q10 content | May help energize skin’s uppermost layers | Only low levels needed for documented efficacy | Independent research on this peptide is lacking | May help protect skin from air polution damage,"Pentapeptide-34 trifluoroacetate is a colorless synthetic peptide also known as Peptide Q10 Biofunctional. That’s because the supplier of this ingredient claims that topical use helps skin boost its supply of the antioxidant coenzyme Q10, which declines with age. In fact, between the ages of 30–80, epidermal levels of this antioxidant can decline as much as 80%! This peptide may also play a role in helping to energize skin’s surface layers so it looks and feels healthier, with fewer visible lines and wrinkles. The use level of pentapeptide-34 trifluoroacetate in cosmetics is 0.5% when in a water- and propanediol-based blend (meaning the concentration of the peptide is much lower, since these bio-active ingredients typically show efficacy at the parts-per-million level). The lack of independent research supporting the supplier claims on this water-soluble peptide is why it’s not rated as highly as some others in this database; however, there’s no reason to be concerned about using this ingredient, since improving skin’s coenzyme Q10 content can help its surface better withstand environmental exposure. This includes helping to protect skin from certain airborne pollutants."
Pentasodium Pentetate,Good,,Chelating Agent,,Used as a chelating agent in cosmetics to prevent various mineral components from binding together and negatively affecting the formulation.
Pentylene Glycol,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Solvent, Preservative","Occurs naturally in some plants (such as sugar beets) | Binds well to water, making it a good hydrating ingredient | Has mild preservative properties | Has been deemed safe as used in cosmetics","Pentylene glycol is an ingredient which is found naturally in some plants (such as sugar beets and corn cobs) but is most frequently lab-derived when used in cosmetics. It is a humectant, meaning it binds well to water, making it a good hydrating agent and solvent to aid penetration of other ingredients. It also helps improve the texture of skin care formulas and has mild preservative properties when used in amounts between 1-5%. There have been some reports that pentylene glycol (along with other glycols) is a skin sensitizer; however, as with many ingredients, the amount and how it’s used are key. In cosmetics formulations the concentration of pentylene glycol ranges from 0.001% to 5%, an amount which the Cosmetics Ingredient Review panel has deemed safe to use in leave-on products."
Phenoxyethanol,Good,,Preservative,Popular synthetic preservative that’s been globally approved for use in cosmetics in up to 1% | Protects formulas from broad-spectrum pathogenic activity | Backed by decades of research and safety assessments | Versatile in that it is compatible in a large range of formulas/pH ranges | Considered gentle on skin (incidence of a sensitized reaction to phenoxyethanol is rare),"Phenoxyethanol is a widely used synthetic preservative with global approval for use in rinse-off or leave-on cosmetic products in concentrations up to 1%. It’s often used in even lower amounts, especially when combined with other preservatives. Phenoxyethanol is incredibly versatile in that it works in a large range of formulas and pH ranges and offers broad-spectrum activity against many pathogens. It is both water and oil soluble and is compatible with many other preservatives used in cosmetics. While phenoxyethanol has gotten a bad rap in recent years, the controversial research behind this movement is not about the cosmetics-grade phenoxyethanol, and that’s important to keep in mind. Think of it this way: even plant extracts have to be purified when they are removed from the ground and put into skin care products. No one wants worms and dirt in their products. Phenoxyethanol is similar in that it’s purified before it’s used in cosmetic formulations, and it in that form it’s safe, backed by decades of safety assessments. Concentration also matters. A 100% concentration of phenoxyethanol comes with some scary warnings. For example, the Safety Data Sheet on this preservative describes it as harmful if it contacts skin, is inhaled, or gets into the eyes but this doesn’t apply to the 1% concentration used in cosmetics. Animal studies where mice were fed large doses of this preservative have also sparked concern. However this is not indicative of how phenoxyethanol is used on skin. Research shows that compared to many other preservatives, the incidence of a sensitized or allergic reaction to phenoxyethanol applied as used in cosmetics is rare. But the truth is all preservatives, even the natural ones, carry some risk of sensitizing skin because preservatives of any kind are meant to kill fungus, bacteria, and mold and that may negatively impact skin. The risk to your skin from such pathogens is far greater than the risk any preservative could present. Ironically, for natural preservatives to be effective, they must be used in much higher amounts than synthetic preservatives, typically up to 10%. Higher amounts may irritate or sensitize skin, so natural preservatives aren’t even close to a slam-dunk replacement for synthetics. An interesting factoid: Although the phenoxyethanol used in skin care products is synthetic, this chemical occurs naturally in green tea."

Phenylalanine,Good,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Antioxidant",Essential amino acid | A precursor to melanin and dopamine | Helps skin retain moisture | Aids in reducing the appearance of an uneven skin tone,"Phenylalanine is what is termed as an essential amino acid, meaning that it does not occur naturally in the human body and must be obtained from food. It plays an important role in the synthesis of other amino acids and is a precursor to the skin pigment melanin and the neurotransmitter dopamine. Phenylalanine is found in the seeds and sprouts of plants such as spinach, sunflowers, peanuts, and many varieties of beans. In addition to its benefit when consumed, research shows phenylalanine also has value when applied topically. As with many amino acids, it helps skin retain moisture for a more hydrated appearance. Studies also indicate that phenylalanine can help to visibly reduce the appearance of an uneven skin tone. This is in part because of its connection to melanin and its ability to inhibit melanin production. Phenylalanine has been shown to be well-tolerated by skin, with no reports of adverse reactions. Usage levels of phenylalanine in cosmetics typically range from 0.00009–0.3% in rinse-off and leave-on formulas."

It has a higher viscosity and a drier finish than some other silicone ingredients. In addition to skin care, you can find phenyl trimethicone in makeup formulations, shaving products and sunless tanners. In hair care, phenyl trimethicone is often used to increase the shininess and smoothness of hair. Phenyl trimethicone has a long history of safe use in beauty products. In 2006, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel reconfirmed its status as a safe ingredient. Their report looked at products using concentrations between 0.0075% to 36%."

Phytic acid is interesting in that when it is ingested, it is considered to be an “antinutrient” to humans; that is, people lack the enzyme phytase needed to break phytic acid down when ingested. As phytic acid passes through the gut, it binds to minerals like calcium, zinc, and iron, making them less readily absorbed. That said, phytic acid also has strong free radical scavenging abilities, making it an excellent antioxidant, and therefore valuable for use in skin care. Studies show it also helps calm skin sensitivity, and emerging research shows it acts as an exfoliant as well. Concentrations between 2–4% are used for exfoliation where it’s often paired with more research-backed exfoliants such as salicylic acid or glycolic acid. It’s sometimes used with these and other exfoliating acids in professional-strength peels to visibly improve skin discolorations. Phytic acid has been deemed safe as used in cosmetics by the Cosmetics Ingredient Review Expert Panel. Concentrations of up to 2% may be used in leave-on products.

It might also appear as Aspen bark extract or Populus tremuloides (Aspen) bark extract on an ingredient list. This bark extract is rich in flavonoids, polyphenolic compounds that help protect skin against the damaging effects of environmental agents. Due to the antioxidant properties that flavonoids possess, this extract can help keep skin looking younger and more even while also allowing it to look and feel firmer, longer. Studies display and outline the presence of salicylates (esters and derivatives of salicylic acid) in Populus tremuloides bark extract. However, the levels of salicylates present are lower than that of willow bark extract and have little chance of working when applied topically to skin in such small amounts. Salicylic acid and its derivates require a set pH range and particular formulary considerations to work properly as an exfoliating ingredient. Populus tremuloides bark extract exhibits antimicrobial benefits. It’s for this reason why this bark extract is touted as a “natural preservative” for skin care products; however, its benefits in this regard are not considered broad, so should not be used as a product’s sole preservative. Suppliers of this ingredient recommend using it in percentages between 0.02% and 3%. *If you are allergic to aspirin, follow your health care provider’s advice about using skin care products with Populus tremuloides Bark Extract."

Propylparaben,Good,,Preservative,,"Propylparaben is a paraben, which is a group of controversial preservatives that also includes butylparaben, isobutylparaben, methylparaben, and ethylparaben. All of these were at one time the most widely used group of preservatives used in cosmetics. Parabens were so popular because of their gentle, non-sensitizing, and highly effective profile in comparison to other preservatives but also because they were derived naturally from plants, a rare phenomenon for a preservative. Parabens are found in plants in the form of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA), a chemical that breaks down to become parabens for a plants own protection. Over the past 10 years parabens have become criticized and condemned for use in cosmetics due to their alleged relation to health concerns affecting women and men. The research about parabens is conflicting and polarizing. Some research indicates they are safe as used in cosmetics and are preferred over other preservatives to keep a formula stable. These studies also showed parabens did not have any effect when compared to natural hormones in the body. However, other research has concluded they are indeed problematic: Some studies determined a 100% concentration of parabens caused skin samples (meaning not intact skin on a person) to break down. However, these studies don’t apply to the tiny amount (1% or less) of parabens typically used in cosmetics. In low amounts, parabens were not shown to harm skin; in fact, they offer a benefit due to their ability to thwart the growth of mold, fungi, and harmful pathogens. Other studies casting parabens in a negative light were based on force-feeding them to rats, a practice that is not only cruel but unrelated to what happens when parabens are applied to skin. There are studies indicating absorption of parabens through skin associated with application of skin care products, but those studies did not take into consideration that parabens are still used as food-grade preservatives or found naturally in plants and that could have been the source not the cosmetics. We also looked at studies showing other questionable effects but those were done in vitro meaning in a petri dish or, again, animal studies in species whose biologic makeup does not closely relate to people. We appreciate the concern about parabens and understand if people choose to avoid them. At Paula’s Choice Skincare we use parabens in a very limited number of products, but that decision is based on other reasons than the scare tactics rampant on the internet. For transparency, we list all ingredients on individual product pages and packaging and our Client Services team is always happy to help."

Biologically, it is a glycoprotein produced by the deep sea extremophile bacterium Pseudoalteromonas antarctica . The strains of the Pseudoalteromonas species bacteria have evolved to thrive in extreme environments by producing compounds that promote survival against predators or unfavorable conditions, such as in very hot or very cold temperatures. The extract is rich in proteins that exhibit skin-restoring properties and polysaccharides (complex sugars) with hydrating and antioxidant benefits. The most known and proven benefit of this ingredient is its ability to retain moisture and protect skin’s surface from dehydration even in extreme conditions, such as cold weather and low humidity. In a small but significant clinical panel, a preparation containing this extract dramatically improved moisture in patients suffering with severe skin dryness. What’s more, it showed very high tolerability. Many in vitro tests have been performed on different compounds found within Pseudoalteromonas ferment extract and showed it is able to promote the correct formation of type 1 and 4 collagens, the most abundant and structurally important collagens in skin, and elastin, all of which support smoother, younger-looking skin. Another compound isolated by this extract has shown in vitro promise on reducing signs of hyperpigmentation, similar to superstar brightening antioxidant ubiquinone. One peptide extracted from Pseudoalteromonas has shown strong sebum-controlling action in vivo and is therefore of interest for its use in cosmetics targeting oily and acne-prone skin. Lastly, the extract from Pseudoalteromonas also contains an array of enzymes known as proteases that are useful in the commercial production of a series of bioactive peptides with restoring and anti-aging properties. The typical recommended use level of Pseudoalteromonas ferment extract in cosmetics is 2% when this ingredient isn’t part of a blend."

It contains complex sugars known as polysaccharides, which makes it a good water-binding agent (i.e. hydration) and antioxidant in skin care products. It is proven to work well as a “carrier” for other skin care actives, effectively delivering the ingredients where they need to go. Additionally, research shows pullulan has the potential to help with strengthening skin’s microbiome. Studies also show it can provide temporary mechanical support for skin’s underlying structures as well as a subtle yet visible lifting effect owing to its non-irritating film-forming properties More recently, pullulan has been utilized in dissolving microneedle patch products where it is believed to enhance transdermal delivery of ingredients. Scientists are also exploring the therapeutic benefits of pullulan-based hydrogel films for various skin conditions. As a texture-enhancing ingredient, characteristics of pullulan include its water solubility and relatively low viscosity compared to other polysaccharides.

It is considered more stable than retinol; however, it also requires more conversion steps within skin to become retinoic acid. As such, retinyl acetate is not considered as effective as other retinoids such as retinyl propionate and retinal (also known as retinaldehyde). When encapsulated in a nanoparticle polymer delivery system, retinyl acetate’s delivery to skin was slower and showed better retainment after 24 hours (as measured on mouse skin). Given its slower conversion and taking a delivery system into account, in theory retinyl acetate may be less likely to provoke irritation in those sensitive to retinol. One study showed a product that contains the retinoids retinol, retinyl acetate, and retinyl palmitate at a combined concentration of 1.1% showed comparable improvements in signs of sun damage as 0.02% tretinoin, a prescription retinoid. Results were most notable on subjects with deep wrinkles after daily use for a period of 24 weeks.

It can have antioxidant benefit for skin, but its aromatic components can cause sensitivity. However, in most skin care products the amount of rosemary extract is unlikely to be a risk, and rosemary extract is much less of a problem for skin than rosemary oil because the extract usually doesn’t contain much, if any, of rosemary oil’s volatile fragrance components. Research has shown that rosmarinic acid, one of the components in rosemary extract, has a calming effect on skin, giving it utility in products for chronically sensitive or temporarily sensitized skin. It also helps improve how skin handles the UV filter oxybenzone, allowing greater tolerability. Along with rosmarinic acid, other primary antioxidants in rosemary leaf include caffeic acid, carnosol, and carnosic acid. All of these help neutralize damaging oxidative molecules before they can cause deeper damage to skin. Even better, they have efficacy in both water- and oil-based formulas. Note: The concentration and composition of the different bioactive compounds found in rosemary extracts are dependent on the geographical zones the leaves were harvested, as well as the method of extraction, thus leading to differences in the efficacy of rosemary extracts from different suppliers. Rosemary leaf extract can also aid a cosmetic formula’s preservative system, allowing a lower use of conventional preservatives which helps make certain products more tolerable for those with sensitive skin. It’s been paired with preservatives sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, and phenoxyethanol. Usage levels of Rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract range from 0.2-5%, depending on formulary goals and whether the plant extract is used on its own or in a blend with ingredients such as glycerin and butylene glycol."

Limited research has shown this plant to be a very capable antioxidant on skin and in the body. It also seems to play a role in fading the appearance of dark spots, but more research is needed to propel this plant to the must-have list for those struggling with discolorations. Specific to its antioxidant ability, it’s noteworthy that this plant has a protective effect on fibroblasts, cells within skin that make collagen. This plant also plays a role in strengthening skin’s barrier by helping to increase urea, one of the substances comprising skin’s natural moisturizing factor, or NMF. In doing so, skin’s hydration is improved, and rough texture is diminished. It’s a good source of potassium, sodium and calcium, minerals which play supportive roles in maintaining healthy skin. The recommended usage level of Salicornia herbacea extract in skin care is 0.25–1% when used in a lipid carrier base. Fun fact: this plant is edible and, due to where it grows best, has a fairly high salt content so is sometimes used to replace salt in certain foods."
Salix Alba (Willow) Bark Extract,Good,Soothing,"Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant","Plant extract with proven skin-soothing, antioxidant benefits | Contains beneficial compounds of salicin, polyphenols, and flavonoids | Also goes by the name willow bark | Often touted as a natural alternative to salicylic acid, however research shows the exfoliation association is questionable","Salix alba (willow) bark extract is a plant extract with proven skin-soothing benefits. It is also known as willow bark. Some skin care brands tout this ingredient as a natural alternative to the salicylic acid (BHA) exfoliants. This association comes from the fact that willow bark contains salicin, a substance that when taken orally is converted by the digestive process to salicylic acid. It’s important to clarify the process of converting willow bark’s salicin into salicylic acid requires the presence of enzymes and other biological complexities. Further, salicin, much like salicylic acid, is stable only under acidic conditions. The likelihood that Salix alba (willow) bark extract in the tiny amount used in cosmetics can mimic the effect of salicylic acid is questionable at best. That said, there are still benefits to Salix alba (willow) bark extract in skin care. Studies indicate the salicin content can offer general anti-aging properties for skin and its other beneficial compounds (including polyphenols and flavonoids) contribute to its antioxidant effects. In skin care, this ingredient is typically used in amounts of 0.5–1%, with a maximum recommended concentration of 10%. Amounts below 0.5% may be used in concert with other soothing ingredients, depending on formulary goals. *If you are allergic to aspirin, follow your health care provider’s advice about using skin care products with _Salix alba_ (willow) bark extract."

Scutellaria Baicalensis Root Extract,Good,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Scutellaria baicalensis root extract comes from a flowering plant native to China, where it’s been used for years as one of the many herbal preparations within the field of Chinese medicine. In China, the extract is known as Huang-Qin or golden herb, because the root is a golden yellow color. It’s primarily used in cosmetics for its promising ability to interrupt the creation and transfer of excess pigment; however, these scientific studies were done in vitro on skin cells, not intact skin on people struggling with dark spots, so what seems exciting in a lab setting may not hold as much promise for topical use. The other issue is the current lack of agreement on how much of this root extract is needed to visibly fade skin discolorations; some say 0.1% is enough, others recommend at least a 1% concentration is necessary, and some blends with this ingredient encourage amounts of 3-10% if the goal is visible improvement of skin color. The root is more exciting because it contains baicalin, wogonoside, baicalein, wogonin, and oroxylin A, all of which are flavones, a type of antioxidant that lend color to various plants and are known to be soothing. Scutellaria baicalensis root can help skin better withstand environmental aggressors that can worsen the look of many common skin concerns, so it certainly has value. Testing on mouse, rabbit, and guinea pig skin revealed that a standardized extract of this ingredient is not irritating or sensitizing, even when the skin was compromised. The conclusion was that Scutellaria baicalensis is a viable option for sensitive skin struggling with signs of uneven skin tone or just in need of soothing."

Sea Water,Good,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Humectant, Solvent","Water obtained from a saltwater body, most often inland | Contains varying amounts of mineral and trace elements | Has humectant and potential soothing properties for skin | Purified prior to use in cosmetics (sea water isn’t contaminant-free) | No restrictions on use level","Sea water is just what you’d think: water obtained from the sea or, more specifically, inland bodies of salt water. As with all types of water, this one has solvent properties but is also a humectant, in part due to its natural mineral and trace element content. Some of the numerous minerals in sea water, such as magnesium, can have soothing properties when applied to skin. Other minerals in sea water include sodium, zinc, potassium, calcium copper, and manganese, although the specific content varies based on where in the world the sea water was obtained as well as the depth of water. Research has shown the primary minerals in sea water, including salt and calcium, have a regulating effect on skin’s barrier. This makes sea water (especially when bathed in) beneficial for certain skin conditions involving barrier impairments. In dermatologist parlance, this is considered “adjunctive therapy”, meaning it complements medical treatments a doctor prescribes to help certain skin disorders improve. Sea water’s acidic nature coupled with its mineral content also seems to play a reparative role when applied to environmentally compromised skin; however, it hasn’t been shown to surpass what numerous antioxidants, including vitamins, can do in this regard. Sea water usage levels in cosmetics do not have a standard range. It can be used in any amount up to 100%, depending on the nature of the formula and desired results. Of course, it’s not exactly the same as taking fresh water from the sea since the sea water used in cosmetics is purified to remove undesirable content in the water."

It’s a biomimetic ingredient that resembles the human collagen alpha-1 (III) chain, a crucial component of type 3 collagen, the second most abundant type in skin. Recombinant human peptides are exciting ingredients touted to support healthy collagen production and tensile strength, resulting in a visible reduction in the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, a decrease in visible skin laxity, improved skin firmness, smoother skin and improved hydration. Although their benefits are impressive, the way they’re created is a true feat of science. Chemists use bioengineering practices to extract a “code” for a desired DNA sequence into a vector, a particle that can replicate in a host cell. In the case of sh-polypeptide-123, this is the code for collagen alpha-1 (III). Then, this vector containing code is introduced into a host cell (for sh-polypeptide-123, it’s Pichia pastoris yeast cells) and fermented. These host cells are then purified and prepared for use in cosmetics as well as supplements. Voilà! You have a recombinant human peptide! Many recombinant human peptides are used in skin care and have research supporting their use, however, research supporting sh-polypeptide-123 is limited with few objective studies outside of cosmetic supplier info. Suppliers of this ingredient recommend using it in concentrations between 0.5%-15.0% when included in an ingredient blend with water and glycerin. It appears as a white powder in raw material form."

Silicone,Good,"Hydration, Oil Control, Pore Minimizer","Hydration, Oil Control, Pore Minimizer, Silicone",,"Substance derived from silica (sand is a silica). The unique fluid properties of silicone give it a great deal of slip, and in its various forms it can feel like silk on skin, impart emollience, and be a water-binding agent that holds up well, even when skin becomes wet. The research about silicones have proven them to be superior scar-healing ingredients, soothing agents, non-irritating, and uniquely effective delivery and suspending agents for a wide range of cosmetic ingredients. There are numerous forms of silicones used in cosmetic products, particularly leave-on skincare products and all manner of hair-care products. Common forms of silicone are cyclopentasiloxane and cyclohexasiloxane; other forms include various types of dimethicone and phenyl trimethicone. Claims that silicones in any form cause or worsen skin concerns have not been substantiated in any published research, nor have reports that silicones are sensitizing to or somehow “suffocate” skin. In fact, just the opposite is true which makes the misinformation difficult to understand. Almost all of the claims about silicones being problematic for skin are apparently myths or based on anecdotal evidence. Because of silicone’s unique molecular properties, they are at the same time porous and resistant though not impermeable to air. Think of silicones in a skincare formula like the covering of a tea bag. When you steep the tea bag in water the tea and all of its antioxidant properties are released into the water. Silicones remain on the surface of your skin and the other ingredients it’s mixed with “steep” through. All ingredients must be suspended in some base formula; some of the ingredients remain on the surface, some are absorbed. The intent is for the “actives” to get through. The special molecular structure of silicones (large molecules with wide spaces between each molecule) allows them to form a permeable barrier and also explains why silicones rarely feel heavy or occlusive, although they still offer protection against moisture loss. Interestingly, silicone has been shown to be helpful for offsetting dryness and flaking from common ingredients such as benzoyl peroxide. Bottom line: The types of silicones used in cosmetic products are supported by scientific research and are considered safe for consumer use. These types of cosmetic silicones are effective, inert, and versatile ingredients that benefit skin and hair in numerous ways."

Soluble Collagen,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",Humectant ingredient that promotes hydration | Traps moisture and reduces transepidermal water loss | Derived from bovine or fish connective tissues and skin | Does not have strong anti-aging benefits | Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed safe for skin,"Soluble collagen is a humectant skin care ingredient that promotes hydration. It’s derived from the connective tissues and skins of animals, most commonly bovine or fish. It’s referred to as soluble collagen because it’s soluble in water. Unlike hydrolyzed collagen, soluble collagen does not undergo hydrolysis, meaning it retains its large molecular size. Because of this, it can’t penetrate skin, but instead it sits atop it, promoting optimal, balanced hydration through the attraction of moisture and mitigation of transepidermal water loss. Through enhanced hydration, this ingredient can also help shore up the skin barrier. There’s a common misconception that applying collagen topically will help with anti-aging concerns. This is simply not true! Collagen within skin and collagen applied to skin work differently. Unfortunately, administering collagen-derived ingredients to the stratum corneum (skin’s outermost layer) doesn’t improve skin laxity or crepiness, but it can help temporarily decrease the look of wrinkles and fine lines due to a plumping effect caused by increased hydration. Soluble collagen and other collagen-related cosmetic ingredients are constantly undergoing research, so more information about these ingredients and their benefits might soon be revealed. For example, research has revealed early insights that marine-derived soluble collagen might assist with wound healing and aging, however, more research is needed to come to a firm conclusion. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel revealed that this hydrator is made up of good-for-skin amino acids like hydroxyproline, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, proline, glycine, alanine and arginine. The panel’s review also disclosed that this ingredient is safe for skin and most used in leave-on cosmetic formats (like moisturizers) in concentrations between 0.00003% and 16.5%."

It has emerged as a promising ingredient linked to longevity due to its significant role in autophagy, a cellular recycling process responsible for regulating key aspects of aging and health. While current research focuses heavily on oral supplementation and medicinal applications, spermidine shows intriguing potential as an anti-aging skin care ingredient as well. One of the more unique areas of scientific exploration regarding spermidine is its ability to help even out hypopigmentation (diffused or localized patches of skin that appear lighter). Studies also suggest spermidine can strengthen skin’s natural protective barrier, provide collagen support and deliver skin-soothing benefits. Beyond skin benefits, research indicates spermidine has benefits for supporting hair and nail growth when taken in supplement form. While more studies are required to fully understand spermidine’s efficacy in skin care products, the available evidence looks promising. We’ll continue to watch this space and update. Spermidine is typically sourced from plant-based materials like wheatgerm and can be found in relatively high levels in dietary foods such as soybeans (especially a fermented version known as natto) and mushrooms. Note: Cosmetic use of spermidine may be restricted in certain global markets."

If an ingredient such as this is absent from certain skin care formulations, the solution would separate (sort of like what you see with certain oil-based salad dressings). Steareth-2 is often combined with other steareth ingredients, such as steareth-21, since this combination provides an elevated sensory experience. Steareth ingredients are prepared by interacting with the chemical intermediate gas ethylene oxide with stearyl alcohol, a process which forms an entirely new stable compound. The number that comes after (for instance, 2) indicates the average number of ethylene oxide units used in the preparation. In 2012, the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel ruled that steareth-2 is safe as used in cosmetics in amounts up to 10%. There have been concerns about the safety of steareth ingredients because toxic 1,4-dioxane, a by-product of ethoxylation, can be produced; however, this is eliminated through purification processes."

Succinic Acid,Good,"Soothing, Anti-Acne","Soothing, Anti-Acne, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer, Chelating Agent",Used in cosmetics to adjust pH and mask unpleasant odors | Produced naturally on skin where it controls the population of C. acnes | Products with succinic acid may play an indirect role in improving breakouts | May be synthetic or obtained via fermentation,"Succinic acid is a synthetic or biofermented ingredient that’s primarily used in cosmetics to adjust pH, serve as a chelating agent, and mask unpleasant odors (although it doesn’t contain fragrance components). This ingredient is often touted for helping with acne, although such marketing claims aren’t strongly supported by scientific research. It’s helpful potential is more indirect, but more definitive research is needed. In terms of succinic acid’s connection to breakouts, research has shown that a strain of bacteria on skin known as S. epidermidis produces succinic acid in order to naturally reduce the population of C. acnes bacteria. However, it’s not certain if the succinic acid is working alone or in tandem with other bacteria comprising skin’s microbiome. Other research has shown succinic acid might be helpful for breakouts because it disrupts the intercellular pH of the C. acnes strain; however, it’s not as potent or thorough in this regard as the gold standard acne ingredient benzoyl peroxide. Keep in mind that too much succinic acid may have a toxic effect on skin cells due to its high acidity (its natural pH hovers around 1, which is highly acidic). To counter this, it must be buffered in solution to pH 3.5 or greater. This has been the case with succinic acid-containing skin care products we’ve encountered to date. Animal research done on mice has shown topical use of fermented succinic acid reduces the inflammation triggered by acne-causing bacteria. However, other research has found that succinic acid does not have such properties, one more reason to not consider it instead of many other soothing skin care ingredients that have unanimous positive research behind them. Usage levels of succinic acid in skin care are typically 1–5%. It may be used in the same formula with salicylic acid, since the benefits of both depend on a more acidic pH range."

Sucrose Cocoate,Good,,"Emollient, Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer","Made from coconut acid but may also be synthetic | Used as a gentle surfactant, emulsifier, and emollient | Improves foaming aesthetic when added to cleansers | Improves texture and spreadability of creams and lotions","Sucrose cocoate is made by combining sugar esters from coconut acid (fatty acids from coconut oil) to create a mild surfactant that also serves as an emulsifier and skin-softening emollient. Although it is usually derived from coconut, synthetic forms also exist. This liquid ingredient is water-loving and has a thick texture that’s relatively easy to incorporate into different types of skin care formulas, both leave-on and rinse-off varieties. Amounts between 2-4% are used as a cleansing agent or to increase foam density, while amounts between 3-5% may be used as emulsifiers and thickening agents in leave-on products. Much lower amounts (well below 1%) are sometimes used in blends, where they serve to keep key ingredients from separating and improve penetration into skin. Sucrose cocoate is considered gentle enough to use in baby care products such as shampoos and lotions, and its safety as used in cosmetics has been established for concentrations as high as 20.6%."
Sucrose Laurate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Cleansing Agent, Emollient, Emulsifier",Created from a combination of sugar and lauric acid | Functions as an emollient/skin-conditioning agent and emulsifier/surfactant | Often touted as a gentle cleansing agent | P&G study suggests blending this ingredient with dilaurate to mitigate skin dulling/yellowing,"Sucrose laurate is classified as an emollient/skin-conditioning agent and emulsifier/surfactant. This versatile, plant-derived ingredient is created from a combination of sugar and lauric acid (one of several fatty acids found in coconut oil, babassu butter and other natural fats). It is often touted as a gentle cleansing agent. A 2022 study funded by Procter & Gamble combined sucrose laurate with dilaurate and suggested this blend to prevent unhealthy yellowish/dull skin appearance after oxidative stress. More independent studies are necessary to validate these effects.

Sulfates,Good,,"Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier",,"In cosmetics, this large group of ingredients is used mainly as cleansing agents in skincare and hair-care products; they include sodium lauryl sulfate, ammonium lauryl sulfate, and sodium laureth sulfate. Many consumers are concerned of sulfates in their cosmetics products because of widespread misinformation. Sulfates are not a problem, but once organizations and companies build up fears among consumers about certain cosmetics ingredients there’s almost no going back, the damage is done. In reality there’s absolutely no research showing that sulfates are a problem in skincare or hair-care products, other than causing sensitivity, but that is also true for the sulfate-free cleansing agents that some cosmetics companies advertise and sell. And, whether or not a cleansing agent will cause sensitivity depends on the amount of sulfate and on other ingredients present in a specific formula. Following are some of the most typical unsupported comments about sulfates: “Sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers are better for hair and skin.” No research has shown that to be even remotely the case. Sulfates are supposed to be terribly drying and damaging to hair, when in fact they function no differently from the cleansing agents in sulfate-free shampoos. Almost every company that touts the fact that they don’t contain sulfates do use detergent cleansing agents such as sodium lauryl sulfoacetate, disodium laureth sulfosuccinate, sodium lauroyl sarcosinate, cocamidopropyl hydroxysultaine, sodium cocoyl isethionate, cocamidopropylamine oxide, and sodium methyl 2-sulfolaurate. Why those are supposedly any better for skin is never explained, and no research is ever cited because none exists. Sometimes these companies list those ingredients as being derived from or coming from coconut to make them sound natural and, by association, better for skin but they all end up being primarily synthetic. That doesn’t make them bad in any way; it’s just that the claims are completely disingenuous. What you need to know is that both the sulfate-free cleansing agents and the sulfate versions can be drying and sensitizing depending on the formulation and/or your skin’s own reaction. All of these cleansing agents remove oil and the gunk from styling products, which is exactly what a shampoo should do. “Sulfates in cleansers are cheap.” This one is true, but so what? Lots of ingredients, both natural and synthetic, are cheap, others are expensive, which has absolutely nothing to do with quality or efficacy. The first ingredient in sulfate-free shampoos is water (about 90% water) and no other cosmetic ingredient is cheaper than that! “Sulfates are used in floor cleaners and are corrosive.” This can be true, when used in large amounts and when left on surfaces over time, but so what? Salt is used to melt ice on the roadway, but it also rusts cars, which doesn’t make salt bad; it just depends on how much you use and how long you leave it on something. This is also true for the alternative sulfate-free shampoos and cleansers as well; they can also be corrosive over time depending on how much is used and how long it is left on. “Sulfates can be sensitizing.” This can absolutely be true, but again, so what? As a general category, sulfates are not sensitizing when used in appropriate amounts in shampoos and cleansers and the same is true for sulfate-free alternative cleansing agents. All of the research about sulfates being sensitizing are from patch tests where a concentration is left on skin under a bandage for 24 hours, which is not how a cleanser or shampoo is used. Sodium lauryl sulfate is considered one of the more sensitizing cleansing agents and we recommend avoiding it when it is high up on the ingredient list, but that’s NOT because it’s a sulfate; rather, it’s because of its interaction with skin."
Surfactant,Good,,"Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier",,"Short term for surface active agent. Surfactants degrease and emulsify oils and fats and suspend soil, allowing them to be washed away. Surfactants are used in most forms of cleansers and many are considered gentle and effective for most skin types. There are several types of surfactants that can be drying and sensitizing for skin. When those are the main ingredients in a facial cleanser, body wash, or shampoo, they should be avoided; the most common among drying, sensitizing surfactants is sodium lauryl sulfate. The similar-sounding ingredient sodium laureth sulfate is fine."
Sweet Almond,Good,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Most often used in its oil form, this ingredient is expressed from almonds.

Specifically, it’s the cell extract from a root callus, soft tissue that forms over a wounded plant surface and can produce growth itself; essentially, a stem cell extract. Much has been made in recent years of plant stem cells’ abilities to rejuvenate skin. Though a lot of it is overstated, research finds that Symphytom officinale callus culture extract does exhibit antioxidant and calming abilities that help fight visible signs of aging. The phenolic compounds within this extract make it a worthwhile ingredient to consider in anti-aging formulas. One note: while comfrey extract itself has alkaloid content that can irritate skin, the same is not true of its callus culture extract. As of the time of this writing, the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel has not reported on the safety of Symphytum officinale callus culture extract as used in cosmetics. According to the supplier, use levels of Symphytum officinale callus culture extract ranges from 0.4–1% in a water base that also contains isomalt, lecithin, and sodium benzoate."

This plant’s fruit and leaves are rich in antioxidants including quercetin, lutein, and α-tocopherol (vitamin E)—all of which have soothing benefits and help neutralize the visible effects of environmental stressors that accelerate the aging process within skin. Tasmannia lanceolata also contains fragrance chemicals, such as eugenol. While fragrance is best avoided in skin care due to the potential for irritation, it’s less concerning in this fruit/leaf extract form as opposed to an oil. If the concentration is low enough that you cannot detect a peppery aroma, you’re likely in the clear. Amounts in skin care typically range from 1–2%. A 2020 clinical study claimed a 2% concentration of Tasmannia lanceolata extract can help with stretch marks by decreasing skin roughness and improving firmness. Suppliers of this ingredient also claim it can help alleviate the sensation of itch and reduce redness. More independent studies are needed to validate these findings. Fun fact: The stems, branches, and twigs of Tasmannia lanceolata are red in color. The flowering of the plant occurs during summer months and the berries are produced during autumn. The leaves of Tasmannia lanceolata are reported to be four times richer in antioxidant content than blueberries (which themselves are considered antioxidant-rich)."

Chelating agents also prevent unwanted changes to a product’s texture, odor, and/or consistency, so are considered good stabilizers. Tetrasodium EDTA is one type of salt form of EDTA. The acronym EDTA is short for ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid, a stabilizer used in cosmetics to prevent ingredients in a given formula from binding with trace elements (particularly minerals) that can be present in water in some cases, added separately. Other EDTAs used in cosmetics include disodium and trisodium EDTAs. While the optimal EDTA salt to be chosen for skin care formulations depends on the final product’s pH, all forms effectively chelate polyvalent minerals like calcium and magnesium. Additionally, EDTA salts have been shown to enhance the performance of antimicrobial preservatives. Tetrasodium EDTA is typically used in amounts of 0.5% or less but is considered safe in cosmetics up to a 2% concentration. Clinical studies have shown it doesn’t penetrate past skin’s surface."

Vitamin K,Good,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant",,"Technically known as phytonadione, vitamin K is a fat-soluble vitamin. Applying vitamin K to the surface of the skin won’t improve the look of unevenness or dark circles. This type of vitamin K is also referred to as vitamin K1. A study published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology examined the effect of applying a gel containing 2% vitamin K plus 0.1% retinol, vitamin E, and vitamin C. Fifty-seven adults with dark circles participated in this 8-week study and the results, while not a slam-dunk, weren’t exactly discouraging either: 47% of the testers noted “fair to moderate” improvement in their dark circles. The majority of testers noticed no change, but the ingredient was well-tolerated. As encouraging as this seems, whether or not the results were from the vitamin K or the other vitamins is unknown. A minimum 1% concentration of vitamin K1 has been shown in animal studies to positively influence wound healing by hastening the natural process damaged skin undergoes as it works to repair itself. It is not known if this principle would apply to intact skin showing signs of aging. The same concentration of vitamin K1 was used in another study to test its results on improving the look of dark circles. Although some improvement was noted, the formula in testing also contained caffeine and emu oil, although the study’s authors concluded that the dark circle benefits were solely attributed to vitamin K. Interestingly, despite somewhat encouraging research, we rarely see products that contain (or are likely to contain) the amounts of vitamin K research has shown can be beneficial."

Hair care products commonly use this multi-industry ingredient to help fix hair into place, which is why it’s commonly incorporated into hair sprays. Skin care and cosmetic products also use this ingredient, tapping into VP/VA copolymer’s ability to hinder TEWL and assist in the suspending and dispersing of ingredients (such as UV filters) in formulas. Suppliers can provide this ingredient as both a powder (in 100% concentration) or as an alcohol-based solution (in 50% concentration). In rinse off products, this copolymer is used in percentages between 0.07-44%, whereas in leave on preparations, it’s utilized in percentages ranging from 0.001-10%. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel reviewed VP/VA copolymer and concluded that it’s safe for use in cosmetics at current usage percentages."
Walnut Oil,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Plant Extracts",,"Emollient, non-fragrant plant oil that is agood source of omega fatty acids for skin, namely linoleic acid; however, walnut oil is highly prone to oxidation, which makes the right packaging critical. Airless of air-restrictive and opaque packaging is a must."
Water,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Solvent",The most widely used cosmetic ingredient | Typically appears as the first ingredient in skin care products | Only a 10% concentration is needed in skin’s outer layers for softness and pliability | Studies show dry skin and oily skin do not have a significant difference in moisture levels,"Water is the most frequently used cosmetic ingredient. Water in skin care products is almost always listed first on an ingredient label because it is usually the ingredient with the highest concentration in the formula. Water’s primary function in skin care formulas is as a solvent. Despite claims of skin’s need for hydration and claims regarding special types of water, it turns out that water for skin may not be as an important ingredient as commonly thought. Only a 10% concentration of water in the outer layer of skin is necessary for softness and pliability in this part of the epidermis, known as the stratum corneum. Studies that have compared the water content of dry skin with that of normal or oily skin do not find a statistically significant difference in moisture levels between them. Further, too much water can be a problem for skin because it can disrupt the essential substances in skin’s surface layers that keep it intact, smooth, and healthy-looking. As an example, recall how skin on your fingers and toes “prune” when you soak in the bathtub or other body of water for too long."
Watercress Extract,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Research indicates that watercress extracts can have antioxidant activity, but that information is limited and was carried out either in vitro or as animal experiments, not in skincare products."
Wheat Amino Acids,Good,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Humectant, Antioxidant",,"A blend of amino acids from wheat protein after it has been broken down via hydrolysis. Most often used in hair-care products as a conditioning agent, but also found in skincare products where it likely has hydrating ability. There is limited research showing that wheat amino acids can penetrate the hair shaft; however, most likely the smaller molecular size of the amino acids can penetrate hair better than whole protein sources."

White Willow,Good,Soothing,"Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant","Plant extract with proven skin-soothing, antioxidant benefits | Contains beneficial compounds of salicin, polyphenols, and flavonoids | Also goes by the name willow bark | Often touted as a natural alternative to salicylic acid, however research shows the exfoliation association is questionable","White willow (_Salix alba_) bark extract is a plant extract with proven skin-soothing benefits. Some skin care brands tout this ingredient as a natural alternative to the salicylic acid (BHA) exfoliants. This association comes from the fact that willow bark contains salicin, a substance that when taken orally is converted by the digestive process to salicylic acid. It’s important to clarify the process of converting willow bark’s salicin into salicylic acid requires the presence of enzymes and other biological complexities. Further, salicin, much like salicylic acid, is stable only under acidic conditions. The likelihood that Salix alba (willow) bark extract in the tiny amount used in cosmetics can mimic the effect of salicylic acid is questionable at best. That said, there are still benefits to Salix alba (willow) bark extract in skin care. Studies indicate the salicin content can offer general anti-aging properties for skin and its other beneficial compounds (including polyphenols and flavonoids) contribute to its antioxidant effects. In skin care, this ingredient is typically used in amounts of 0.5–1%, with a maximum recommended concentration of 10%. Amounts below 0.5% may be used in concert with other soothing ingredients, depending on formulary goals. *If you are allergic to aspirin, follow your health care provider’s advice about using skin care products with _Salix alba_ (willow) bark extract."

It is produced from the fermentation of simple sugars. The fermentation process uses the bacteria Xanthomonas campestris , which is where this ingredient’s name is derived. Xanthan gum in skin care is used as a thickening agent, texture enhancer, and to stabilize emulsions, which is a general term for mixtures of unlike substances such as oil and water. Because of this ability it is also included as an additive in many food products, particularly in sauces and salad dressings."
Ximenia Americana Oil,Good,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,Latin name for plum oil; it can have emollient properties.
Xylitylglucoside,Good,"Hydration, Soothing","Hydration, Soothing, Humectant",,"An ingredient derived from two water-binding plant sugars, xylitol and glucose. Its trade name is Aquaxyl. It works to improve skin moisturization by preventing water loss."

The types of yeast used in cosmetic products are not harmful and in fact likely contribute to creating a healthier-looking skin surface due to their softening and conditioning action."
Zanthoxylum Bungeanum Fruit Extract,Good,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Fruit from a plant also called prickly ash | Major component of Sichuanese cuisine | Has natural analgesic properties | Component of an ingredient blend called Zanthalene ®,"Zanthoxylum bungeanum fruit extract comes from a plant known commonly as Chinese prickly ash or huajiao . Seeds from the prickly ash are a major component of Sichuanese cuisine thanks to their aromatic and numbing properties. This fruit has also been used for centuries as a traditional herbal medication to treat ailments ranging from stomach issues to skin conditions. Interestingly, the numbing effect isn’t the result of an irritant response; rather, it is because of this fruit’s natural analgesic (pain-relieving) properties and how it reacts with taste receptors on the human tongue. Its purpose in Sichuan spice mixes is to mitigate the effects of some of the other ingredients included. As with most plant extracts, Zanthoxylum bungeanum delivers antioxidant benefits to help fight free-radical damage. Studies have also found that it has anti-inflammatory properties. Of particular interest is research pointing to the topical application of Zanthoxylum bungeanum fruit extract having lifting abilities. Some of these studies involved a commercial ingredient blend called Zanthalene ® which includes this extract. The makers of Zanthalene ® refer to it as “phyto-Botox ®”, implying that it has the same (or at least similar) visibly lifting properties as Botox ® (botulinum toxin), the well-known prescription injectable used to temporarily prevent the contraction of muscles which lead to wrinkles. While Zanthoxylum bungeanum fruit extract does have short-term and long-term wrinkle-fighting abilities, no research thus far has demonstrated that they are equal to those provided by prescription Botox ®, so it is important to take these claims with a grain of salt. That said, it is still an intriguing ingredient to add to your skin care arsenal, provided you temper expectations."
Zea Mays Corn Starch,Good,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Absorbent, Film-Forming Agent, Texture Enhancer",Starch obtained from corn that can be formulated to serve different roles | Most famously used as an absorbent that tempers shine on oily skin | Also functions as a viscosity increasing ingredient and film-forming agent | OTC monographed as a skin protectant when formulated under particular conditions | Can also be used as an abrasive agent (not recommended in this capacity for the safety of skin),"Zea mays (corn) starch is quite literally the starch derived from varietals of corn. As a skin care ingredient, it’s most famously used as an absorbent that lends mattifying properties (helpful for controlling oily skin) and is also popular in makeup powders where it lends a dry yet silky feel and can be lighter on skin than some grades of talc. Zea mays (corn) starch can also be incorporated to increase the viscosity of cosmetic solutions (similar to how corn starch is used in cooking to thicken food). In additional capacities, it is blended with other ingredients to create film-forming properties on skin. Zea mays (corn) starch may also be used as an abrasive agent, such as you might find in manual exfoliating products. When formulated in this way, there’s potential for skin sensitization due to the abrasiveness and uneven shape of particles. Interestingly, topical starches, such as corn starch, are classified as skin protectants under the U.S. FDA monograph when formulated as an OTC (over the counter) active. This means they serve to protect skin from harmful stimuli and provide relief to compromised skin. These varying roles demonstrate that how an ingredient is incorporated into a formula plays a major factor in overall efficacy, aesthetics, functions, gentleness, and benefits. In their 2013 report, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel surveyed 278 personal care products containing Zea mays (corn) starch ranging between 0.00002-99% concentration. Based on their analysis, Zea mays (corn) starch is safe in these cosmetic practices of use. Common names and alternative spellings include: corn starch and cornstarch."
Zinc Gluconate,Good,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Preservative",,"The zinc salt of gluconic acid, a mild acid produced from the sugar glucose. Despite the in-part sugar origins, this is a synthetic ingredient that functions as a preservative. Interestingly, the human body produces gluconates on its own to assist in obtaining nutrients from minerals. There’s research showing oral consumption of zinc gluconate may be helpful for acne; however, it wasn’t compared with other oral options for acne, such as antibiotics and isotretinoin, an oral retinoid. Zinc gluconate is considered safe as used in cosmetics. t’s also used in over-the-counter oral lozenges designed to combat the common cold."
Zinc Pyrithione,Good,,Preservative,Cosmetic preservative that is effective against many pathogens | Most popular in anti-dandruff shampoos | May be suitable for “fungal acne” | Comes in the form of white to slightly yellow crystals as a raw material,"Zinc pyrithione is a cosmetic preservative and anti-fungal ingredient that is effective against many pathogens. It’s been in use for over 50 years and is most popular as an active ingredient in over-the-counter anti-dandruff shampoos. It’s also found in body washes, facial cleansers, treatment creams, and other personal care products. It is approved by the United States Food & Drug Administration for use in leave-on products in amounts between 0.1–0.25% and from 0.3–2% when formulated for use in rinse-off products. These amounts are considered safe for skin. Zinc pyrithione’s mechanism of action still isn’t completely understood; researchers just know it works for a wide range of concerns related to overgrowths of various strains of yeast and other fungi. It seems to have a disruptive effect on these substances, dismantling them so they can no longer replicate and cause further problems for skin and scalp. Interestingly zinc pyrithione tends to work differently depending on what it’s up against, one of the reasons it works for such a broad range of yeast-related issues. In recent years, zinc pyrithione has gained attention in social media circles as a key ingredient to treat “fungal acne” (also known as Malassezia folliculitis). While there are studies supporting this assertion, diagnosis and treatment of this condition should be handled by dermatologist. As a raw material, zinc pyrithione comes in the form of white to slightly yellow crystals. Technically speaking, this is an aromatic zinc compound, which is a chemistry term to describe an ingredient whose molecular structure has a specific ring structure referred to as “aromatic”. This is not to be confused with “aromatic” as in perfume or fragrance ingredients."
Zinc Stearate,Good,,"Texture Enhancer, Coloring Agent/Pigment",,"The zinc salt of stearic acid. It has multiple functions in cosmetics, including serving as the basis for soap. Also functions as a coloring agent, slip agent, and texture enhancer."
Zizyphus Jujuba Fruit Extract,Good,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,Zizyphus jujuba fruit extract (commonly known as jujube) delivers soothing properties and may also provide other benefits for skin.
Sorbitan Palmitate,Good,,"Emulsifier, Cleansing Agent",Primarily used in skin care as an emulsifier | Considered a nonionic surfactant (mild cleansing agent) | Capable of improving spreadability and dispersing ingredients | May be plant- or animal-derived or synthetic,
Acacia Farnesiana Extract,Average,,"Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Irritant",Also known as “sweet acacia” | Flowers + oil are highly fragrant and potentially irritating | Has astringent capabilities | Pods have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties,"Acacia farnesiana extract, also known as Vachellia farnesiana extract, is the general term for the extracts of a tree commonly known as “sweet acacia.” This tree is found all over the world, from North and South America to Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Depending on which part of the plant is used, Acacia farnesiana has a broad range of applications. The flowers and oil should be avoided in skin care products, as they’re highly fragrant (it’s well-known in Europe as a perfuming agent called “cassie”). The flower and oil’s volatile compounds – among them linalool and geraniol - can cause skin irritation and are astringent when applied to skin. Its pods, on the other hand, have demonstrated antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties in research performed on mice skin. Parts of the plant have also been used in some cultures as a treatment for stomach ailments. When it comes to this extract, it’s another example of why it’s so important to pay attention to the label of skin care products so you know exactly what you’re getting!"
Acetyl Tributyl Citrate,Average,,Film-Forming Agent,,"Related to citric acid and used as a plasticizer, most commonly in nail polish and nail-hardening products."
Acid,Average,,"Exfoliant, pH Adjuster/Stabilizer",,Anything with a pH lower than 7 is considered acidic; above 7 is considered alkaline. Water has a pH of 7. Skin has an average pH of 5.5
Albumen,Average,,Film-Forming Agent,Another name for egg white | Used as food and as a food additive | Has skin tightening properties that can cause irritation | Extracted peptides could have anti-aging benefits,"Albumen is another term for egg white, specifically egg white originating from chickens. It is different from the similarly spelled albumin, the main type of protein found in human blood, although confusingly, albumin is found in egg whites. Albumen has numerous applications, most commonly as a lower-cholesterol alternative to egg yolks, and as a food additive. Some people also use it as a do-it-yourself face mask, since applying egg whites has a temporary tightening effect on skin, thanks to its ovomucoid content (ovomucoid is a protein that has constrictive properties). Unfortunately, that constriction can lead to skin itching and redness. Ovomucin is also one of the primary allergens in eggs, meaning it’s to be avoided if you have an egg allergy. That said, some components from egg white, when extracted in a lab setting, are proving to have great potential in the world of skin care. Of interest are lab-extracted peptides from egg whites, which studies show positively impact skin wound healing. Scientists have also found proteins within egg whites that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities, making this an exciting emerging area of research."
Alcloxa,Average,,"Irritant, Exfoliant, Cleansing Agent",Combination of sodium salt of aluminum + allantoin | Used for wound healing and burn treatment | Has antimicrobial properties | Can be an astringent | Also known as aluminum chlorohydroxy allantoinate,"Alcloxa, also known as aluminum chlorohydroxy allantoinate, is a combination of a sodium salt of aluminum and anti-irritant allantoin. In professional medical settings, alcloxa is used for wound healing and burn treatment. That’s because it has antimicrobial properties as well as its soothing abilities. In addition, it functions as a mild keratolytic agent (meaning it can help slough off damaged skin). In cosmetics, alcloxa is used in antiperspirants and some skin care products, where it can serve as an astringent, producing a cooling sensation. These astringent properties can cause skin irritation, meaning that it’s best to avoid long-term use of alcloxa in leave-on products. The United States Food and Drug Administration has authorized use of alcloxa in one medical preparation in amounts between 0.2 - 2%. The independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review hasn’t issued its own ruling on the safety of alcloxa, instead deferring to the FDA’s ruling that it is safe to use in these percentages."
Alcohol,Average,,"Emollient, Cleansing Agent, Irritant",,"“Alcohol” refers to a group of organic compounds with a vast range of forms and uses in cosmetics and in other types of products and solutions. For skin, there are good alcohols and bad alcohols, corresponding to high-molecular-weight alcohols and low-molecular-weight alcohols, respectively, which can have emollient properties (cetyl alcohol) or act as detergent cleansing agents like isopropanol. There also are benign forms, including glycols, which are used as humectants to help hydrate and deliver ingredients into skin’s uppermost layers. Alcohols with low molecular weights - the bad-for-skin kind - can be drying and sensitizing. The alcohols to be concerned about in skin care products are ethanol or ethyl alcohol, denatured alcohol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, SD alcohol, and benzyl alcohol . The concern is when one or more of these are listed among the main ingredients; tiny amounts in an otherwise good formula aren’t a problem. In addition to being drying and sensitizing, these alcohols can disrupt skin’s surface layers. Alcohol helps ingredients like retinol and vitamin C penetrate into the skin more effectively, but it does that by breaking down the surface layers of skin - destroying the very substances that keep your skin feeling healthier and looking younger over the long term. Alcohols like SD and “denatured” immediately harm the skin, starting a chain reaction of damage that continues long after it has evaporated. A 2003 study published found that with regular exposure to alcohol-based products, cleansing becomes a damaging ordeal - skin is no longer able to keep water and cleansing agents from penetrating into it, thus further eroding its surface layers. It also destroyed the substances in skin that help to naturally soothe and defend it against visible effects of environmental damage. If that weren’t bad enough, exposure to alcohol causes healthy substances in skin to literally self-destruct. The research also showed that these destructive, aging effects on skin’s substances increased the longer the exposure to alcohol; that is, two days of exposure was dramatically more harmful than one day, and that is only from exposure to a 3% concentration (most skin care products with denatured alcohol contain greater amounts than that). In short, for the healthy appearance of skin at any age, avoiding products that contain high amounts of the drying, sensitizing types of alcohol is a non-negotiable skin care must."
Allium Sativum Garlic Bulb Extract,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Touted as a skin conditioning agent | Backed by research for antifungal properties | Natural source of antioxidants and peptides | More research is needed to conclusively comment on irritation potential,"Allium sativum (garlic) bulb extract is touted as a skin conditioning agent and is backed by research as an antifungal ingredient. Studies indicate it also has potential for mitigating environmental stressors thanks to its many antioxidant compounds. Adding to the anti-aging benefits, garlic extracts offer natural peptide compounds—although their benefits for skin are not comparable to more targeted/stabilized lab-engineered peptides. Worth noting, it’s possible that volatile compounds (primarily one known as allicin) of this naturally aromatic ingredient may be retained during processing, hence making it a potential skin irritant since allicin is a sulfur compound. Studies in this regard aren’t conclusive; in fact, there’s evidence that allicin is anti-inflammatory and can play a helpful role in skin healing, although that was with a high (30%) concentration. While researchers point out that garlic has a long history of use for medicinal purposes, including skin issues, at the time of this writing no formal Cosmetic Ingredient Review safety assessment has been performed for Allium sativum (garlic) bulb extract. All in all, Allium sativum (garlic) bulb extract appears to offer promise for skin in some regards, but we’d like to see more studies to confirm its non-irritancy and safety for use on skin."
Alumina,Average,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Absorbent, Texture Enhancer","Naturally occurring mineral also called aluminum oxide | Used as an abrasive, thickener, and absorbent in cosmetics | Also functions as a coating agent for some powders, such as titanium dioxide | Determined safe as used in cosmetics and medications | The primary component of rubies, emeralds, and sapphires","Alumina is the common name of the ingredient aluminum oxide. It is a naturally occurring mineral used as an abrasive, a thickener, and an absorbent in cosmetics. Alumina is sometimes used as part a coating blend for nano-sized mineral UV filters such as titanium dioxide. This coating keeps the very fine power particles of the mineral sunscreen on skin’s surface since the coating materials are a larger molecular size. These coating blends also improve the aesthetics and even application of mineral sunscreen ingredients. In skin care preparations, alumina is used in amounts up to 25%. It’s been determined safe as used in cosmetics by the independent Cosmetic Ingredient Review panel. It is also approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a color additive for use in certain over-the-counter drugs. Alumina in its natural form is a white solid. It is the third hardest naturally occurring substance, and is the primary component of rubies, emeralds, and sapphires (their color is determined by small impurities found in heavy metals)."
Aluminum Silicate,Average,Oil Control,"Oil Control, Absorbent",,Salt that has absorbent and abrasive properties.
Aluminum Sulfate,Average,,"Absorbent, Irritant",Salt of aluminum | Used as a food additive and medical anticoagulant | Frequently used in deodorant as an absorbent | Also an astringent | Can cause skin sensitivity,"Aluminum sulfate is a salt of aluminum. It has numerous commercial and retail applications, including as a food additive and anticoagulant in medical settings. It is also used in water treatment to coagulate (change a fluid to a semi-solid or solid state) impurities so they can be filtered out. In cosmetics, aluminum sulfate is known for its absorbent and astringent properties and is a frequent additive in deodorants. It can create a tingling or cooling sensation when applied to skin. Though aluminum sulfate is deemed Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the United States FDA, it can cause skin irritation, especially in those sensitive to aluminum. Note that this side effect can be more pronounced when applied via deodorant to just-shaved underarms. In its raw form, aluminum sulfate is a white crystalline solid. Amounts between 15–25% are standard when this ingredient is used in deodorants. Other cosmetics typically contain less than 1% aluminum sulfate. Interestingly, clinical studies of persons with known allergies to dust mites, pet dander and more showed that topical use of aluminum sulfate blunted the allergen’s impact on skin."
Amber Powder,Average,,Absorbent,Powder made from the fossilized resin of trees | Can be used as a mild physical exfoliant | Also used as a bulking and thickening agent | Not a significant source of antioxidants,"Amber powder is made from the finely-ground fossilized resin of trees (mostly varieties of pine trees). Amber is best known for its application in its solid form in jewelry. When powdered, it is added to skin care products as a mild physical exfoliant. It can also be added to formulas to provide bulk or to help thicken product texture. Despite its plant origin – and some claims made by cosmetics companies – amber powder is not considered to be a significant source of antioxidants. Because of its fossilized nature, it is also not a fragrant ingredient as some freshly derived tree resins can be. Usage levels for amber powder in cosmetics haven’t been formally established."
Ammonium Chloride,Average,,"pH Adjuster/Stabilizer, Absorbent, Emulsifier, Texture Enhancer",Used to increase cosmetic products’ viscosity | Also used commercially as a dough strengthener | Can cause skin sensitivity | White crystalline solid in its raw form,"Ammonium chloride is an inorganic salt (a type of salt missing carbon and hydrogen bonds) that is used in cosmetics primarily to boost a product’s texture, particularly its viscosity. In commercial food preparations, ammonium chloride is used as a dough strengthener. The European Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) High Production Volume (HPV) chemical program has determined, based upon research presented, that ammonium chloride is not an allergen. However, it did note some instances of skin sensitization, meaning that if you have a known sensitivity to ammonium chloride, it should be avoided. In its raw form, ammonium chloride is a white crystalline solid. Amounts between 15–20% are standard when aluminum chloride is used in deodorants or anti-perspirants."
Ammonium Hydroxide,Average,,pH Adjuster/Stabilizer,,"Clear, colorless liquid used in cosmetics to adjust a product’s pH. Ammonium hydroxide is synthetic and sometimes used instead of sodium hydroxide to maintain an acidic pH in AHA (alpha hydroxy acid) or similar exfoliant products. The small amounts used in cosmetics are not considered sensitizing on skin."
Ammonium Polyacrylate,Average,,"Film-Forming Agent, Suspending/Dispersing Agent, Texture Enhancer","Primarily categorized as an emulsion stabilizer and film-forming ingredient | May also be used as a dispersing agent, emulsifier, and thickener | Used in a wide range of products including facial masks, makeup, hairspray, and nail care | Deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel","Ammonium polyacrylate is a synthetic ingredient that functions as an emulsion stabilizer in skin care formulas and other types of beauty products. Additionally, it can be used as a film-forming ingredient where it imparts film on skin, hair, or nails which is useful for a wide range of products including facial masks, makeup, hairspray, and nail care. There isn’t much independent research on ammonium polyacrylate as a cosmetic ingredient at the time of this writing, but suppliers of ammonium polyacrylate tout it as a dispersing agent, emulsifier, and thickener, indicating the wide variety of roles it can play in personal care product formulas. Ammonium polyacrylate was deemed safe by the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel in their 2019 assessment. This report looked at personal care products containing ammonium polyacrylate in concentrations ranging from 0.000001-1.8%."
Angelica Polymorpha Sinensis Root Extract,Average,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Irritant, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant","Herb frequently used in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean traditional medicine | Primarily used to treat internal issues | Contains antioxidants, polyphenols, and phytoestrogens | Also contains compounds that can cause rash when exposed to sunlight | Other names include dong quai root extract","Angelica polymorpha sinensis root extract, also known as Angelica sinensis root extract or dong quai extract, is a type of herb used frequently in Chinese, Japanese, and Korean traditional medicines. Its main function in this capacity is as an oral treatment for various internal ailments, including some blood disorders. Recent studies have found that Angelica polymorpha sinensis root extract does contain several beneficial components, among them antioxidants, polyphenols, and phytoestrogens. These can have anti-aging and soothing effects when applied topically. Unfortunately, this root also contains some fragrant compounds that can react with sunlight and cause a rash or severe sunburn, making this an ingredient that we recommend be used with caution."
Aroma/Flavor,Average,,Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural,,"Seeing “aroma/flavor” on an ingredient list can be either good or bad. For example, if the aroma or flavor comes from mint or citrus, it can be sensitizing. But if the source is something more innocuous, like vanilla, then it shouldn’t pose a risk. According to the Personal Care Product Council’s Ingredient Database, “Aroma is a term for ingredient labeling used to identify that a product contains a material or combination of materials normally added to a cosmetic to produce or to mask a particular flavor.” The point to be aware of is what kind of flavor your lips (or skin) are being exposed to - and whether or not the exposure poses a risk of sensitivity. Last, be aware that highly flavored lip products can encourage lip-licking - after all, such products do tend to taste goodâ€”but they shouldn’t be eaten, and licking your lips too often can cause or worsen dry lips."

It’s taken from the roots of Belamcanda chinensis , also known as Iris domestica, Blackberry lily or leopard lily, a perennial flower with orange and yellow blossoms. The plant extract contains irisflorentin and has soothing properties that help calm skin and ease signs of irritation. Despite claims to the contrary, there’s no published scientific evidence that this plant can control skin’s oil production or boost cell turnover rate for smoother skin. Belamcanda chinesis rhizomes are commonly used in traditional medicinal practices in Eastern Asian countries. Most of the research which notes this plant’s antioxidant benefits centers around extracts derived from the plant’s rhizome (underground portion of a plant’s stem), which contains flavonoids and isoflavonoids."
Bellis Perennis,Average,"Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone","Anti-Aging, Evens Skin Tone, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Plant ingredient also known as daisy extract | Helps protect skin from pro-aging damage | Might firm and promote an even skin tone | Can contain skin-sensitizing components,"Bellis perennis extract is a plant extract and antioxidant skin care ingredient more commonly known as daisy extract. Extracts can come from both the flowers and stems of the Bellis perennis plant and commonly contain saponins and phenolic compounds. If it’s from the flower only, the ingredient name would be Bellis Perennis (Daisy) Flower Extract. Thanks to the plant’s antioxidant properties, Bellis perennis helps protect skin from environmental damage and can promote a more even skin tone through the interruption of melanin-producing enzymes within skin’s surface layers. Early studies suggest that Bellis perennis flower extract can improve firmness through the stimulation of supportive compounds within skin. However, more research needs to be done for this to be an accepted claim. Daisy extract isn’t an anti-aging wunderkind. Bellis perennis (daisy) extract’s dark side is that it can contain a skin-sensitizing plant metabolite, sesquiterpene lactone. Overall, there are better, more studied antioxidants available that deliver benefits without risks of sensitization. Note: Daisy extract can cross-react with feverfew extract, a soothing plant used in some skin care products. It’s best to avoid products that contain both ingredients, especially if you have a known history of allergies to plants in the Chrysanthemum family. According to supplier-provided information, Bellis perennis extract can be used in cosmetics between 1.0%-5.0%."
Benzalkonium Chloride,Average,,"Cleansing Agent, Preservative",,Used as a preservative in skincare products. It can be a skin sensitizer.
Benzyl Alcohol,Average,,"Preservative, Solvent, Texture Enhancer",An organic alcohol that can be found naturally in some fruits | Serves chiefly as a preservative in cosmetics products | Considered one of the least sensitizing preservatives in use | Deemed safe for use in concentrations up to 5%,"Benzyl alcohol is an organic alcohol that occurs naturally in some fruits (such as peaches, apricots, and cranberries) as well as teas. Recent studies have found topically applied benzyl alcohol might help wound healing by promoting collagen production, however this is not its primary function in cosmetics products. Its chief function in cosmetics is as a preservative, and it’s among the least sensitizing preservatives in use. Benzyl alcohol works well as a preservative because it has both antibacterial and antifungal properties. High amounts of benzyl alcohol can impart a noticeable floral-like scent to products, as it is part of the fragrance makeup of some essential oils such as jasmine. As a volatile alcohol, it can pose a risk of sensitivity when used in high amounts but is considered safe as used in cosmetics (usually in concentrations up to 5%, and it may be used up to 10% in hair dyes)."
Biotin,Average,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration",,"Also known as vitamin H, a water-soluble vitamin produced in the body. Considered part of the B complex group of vitamins, biotin is necessary for the metabolism of carbohydrates, fats, and amino acids (the building blocks of protein). However, it has no reported benefit for skin when applied topically."
Birch Bark Extract,Average,"Anti-Aging, Soothing","Anti-Aging, Soothing, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Extract derived from the plant Betula alba (common name white birch). It can have antioxidant properties, but can also have astringent properties, which makes it a potential sensitizer for skin if it is one of the main ingredients in a product."
Birch Leaf Extract,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Birch leaf extract is an extract derived from the plant Betula alba (common name white birch). It can have antioxidant properties, but can also have astringent properties, which makes it a potential sensitizer for skin if it is one of the main ingredients in a product."
Bismuth Oxychloride,Average,,"Coloring Agent/Pigment, Absorbent",,"Bismuth oxychloride, is a synthetic pearl and is the primary ingredient included in most powders that are referred to as “mineral makeup.” It functions as a pigment or pearlizing agent and can also be used as substrate for other pigments(i.e. iron oxides). Bismuth oxychloride does occur in nature, but not in significant quantities to be comercially viable. Some cosmetic companies claim that bismuth oxychloride is natural and better for skin than talc. The truth is that in many ways talc is a more natural, unadulterated, pure ingredient than bismuth oxychloride. Bismuth oxychloride is manufactured by combining bismuth, a by-product of lead and copper metal refining, with chloride (a chlorine compound) and water. It’s used in cosmetics because it has a distinct shimmery, pearlescent appearance and a fine white powder texture that adheres well to skin. Bismuth oxychloride is heavier than talc. Pure bismuth is a naturally occurring, grayish-white powder. It and its derivatives are used as skin protectives, thickeners, and absorbent agents. Bismuth oxychloride was permanently listed by the FDA as a coloring agent in 1977 and for use as a synthetic ingredient. Some people react to bismuth oxychloride due to its unique crystalline structure. What happens is that the crystals can “poke” at skin and get stuck in the pores, where the sharper “spokes” can cause irritation. This is more of a problem when bismuth oxychloride is the main ingredient in powder makeup. Pure concentrations of bismuth oxychloride nanoparticles appear to have a negative effect on human skin cells."
Blue 1,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,"Synthetic pigment used to add color to makeup, food products, and skin care | Ruled safe in its current use","Blue 1 is a synthetic pigment used to add color to makeup, as well as skin care and food products. It is water-soluble. The United States Food and Drug Administration has ruled Blue 1 safe in its current use."
Blue 1 Lake,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,Blue 1 lake is a water-insoluble pigment used in cosmetics. It also used as a food coloring and made from combining an organic pigment with one or more minerals.
Boswellia Serrata Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Antioxidant",,"An extract from the gum resin of a tree and also a source of Indian frankincense, this plant extract has both positive and negative qualities for skin. Its fragrant components have the potential to be sensitizing. On the flipside, Boswellia serrata also has research showing it has an skin-soothing effect. Clearly there’s some benefit for skin, but there are potential risks, too, just like with lots of other fragrant plant extracts."
Botanicals,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural",,"General term for a large group of natural ingredients. Botanicals may or may not be organic, and their benefit or risk for your skin depends on the specific botanical in question. Simply put, there are many helpful botanical (natural) ingredients for skin but there are also many that are a must to avoid. Unfortunately, many of the most problematic botanicals routinely show up in skincare products from lines that work overtime to convince you they’re better for you because they only contain natural/botanical ingredients. Shopping for products with botanical/natural ingredients without knowing which ones to avoid is a surefire way to cause needless sensitivity that leads to a host of skin problems."
Bronze Powder,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,Mineral coloring agent derived from copper. Permanently listed (since 1977) by the FDA as a safe coloring additive.
Bupleurum Falcatum Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"A plant used in Chinese medicine for a variety of ailments. Some research has shown this extract to have skin-soothing and antioxidant properties. There is no research showing extracts of this plant have any benefit when applied to skin. It does contain glucoside and polysaccharide, but whether these can affect skin through topical application of the extract is unknown."
Caffeine,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",,"Caffeine is the chief stimulant in beverages such as coffee and tea. Due to caffeine’s ability to increase the microcirculation of blood in the skin, it’s often included in skin care products with claims that it will improve the look of cellulite or puffy eyes. Unfortunately, research into caffeine’s effects in this regard are mixed. Caffeine’s popularity in products related to cellulite is due to its distant relationship to aminophylline (an ingredient once thought to improve the look of cellulite), which is a modified form of theophylline, and caffeine contains theophylline. Applied to skin, caffeine may have soothing and antioxidant properties, especially when skin is exposed to UV light. It can penetrate skin and has a constricting effect, which can help improve the look of redness but also may be sensitizing. When it comes to puffy eyes, there is no research indicating caffeine can have any benefit; in fact, research has shown caffeine has an inhibitory action on a key protein in skin that helps it look younger. Truly, it’s a mix of pros and cons for skin, though lower amounts (less than 1%) in skin care products probably don’t present much, if any, risk."
Calamine,Average,,"Irritant, Absorbent, Occlusive/Opacifying Agent","Solution that includes zinc oxide and iron oxide | Used as an absorbent and skin soothing treatment | Can have short-term benefits for skin conditions | Long-term use can result in dryness, irritation, and barrier damage","Calamine, more commonly known as calamine lotion, is an over-the-counter product intended to help alleviate itching and oozing from several skin conditions, including poison ivy and chickenpox. Calamine lotion is not composed of a single ingredient, rather it is a zinc oxide-based solution that includes iron (III) oxide, also known as ferric oxide (which give it its signature muted pink color), and additional ingredients such as phenol, glycerin, or even menthol, depending on the preparation. Its primary benefit is its ability as an absorbent for weeping skin, and as a soothing agent. Calamine lotion has a wealth of research demonstrating its short-term benefits when applied topically. The issue is overuse, when its absorbency can lead to skin drying out too much, leading to irritation, scaling and barrier damage. It’s also important to double check the adjunct ingredients in the calamine lotion you’re using to make sure they don’t include additional irritating components such as the previously mentioned menthol or drying forms of alcohol."
Calcite,Average,,"Coloring Agent/Pigment, Texture Enhancer",Most common form of calcium carbonate | Used in its powdered form in cosmetics | Functions as a makeup pigment | Also used as a texture enhancer,"Calcite is a mineral that is the most common form of calcium carbonate. It is one of the components of limestone. In its raw state it is a crystal, though powdered calcite is the form used in cosmetics. Because of its white color, calcite has often been used as a pigment both in paints and cosmetics, dating back to ancient times. It’s still used as an approved colorant in modern makeup. In addition to its function as a color additive, calcite is also used as a texture enhancer in skin care products, where it helps thicken formulas and enhances the creamy feel of moisturizers. It is sometimes used as a substitute for talc. Typical usage levels range between 0.2–2%."
Cananga Odorata,Average,,"Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Plant Extracts, Irritant, Antioxidant",,"Cananga odorata , more commonly known as ylang-ylang, is a type of flowering tree native to parts of Southeast Asia and Australia. Depending on what part of the plant is used, it can be a skin sensitizer. For more information, see our definition for Cananga odorata flower extract."
Cananga Odorata Flower Extract,Average,,"Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",Flower extract from a tree better known as ylang-ylang | One of the most-used materials in perfuming | Can have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits | Oil from this flower is highly volatile | Oil contains sensitizing aromatic compounds,"Cananga odorata flower extract is the extract of the flower of a tree, more commonly known as ylang-ylang, native to Southeast Asia and Australia. It is one of the most-used materials in perfuming and is often called “The Queen of Perfumes.” The flower of the ylang-ylang plant is rich in potentially beneficial components, including antioxidants that also exhibit anti-inflammatory properties. When those are directly extracted from the flower, isolated, and used in skin care products, they can help fight signs of aging. Unfortunately, in most applications Cananga odorata flower oil extract – is added to leave-on products. While the oil also has antioxidants, it also contains numerous volatile fragrance compounds, among them linalool, geraniol, and benzyl salicylate. All these compounds have been shown to cause skin irritation and sensitization, making Cananga odorata flower oil extract an ingredient to avoid in skin care. It’s best instead to stick to using it for perfume or aromatherapy!"
Capsicum,Average,,"Irritant, Plant Extracts",,"Capsicum is the name for a genus of flowering plants native to North America that includes chili peppers and bell peppers. Several chemical compounds can be extracted from these plants and used in medical applications. For more information, see our definitions of capsaicin and capsicum oleoresin."
Caramel,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,Natural coloring agent.
Carica Papaya Leaf Extract,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts",Plant extract derived from the leaf of the Carica papaya plant | Antioxidant properties help curb the aging effects of environmental stress | Helps skin maintain a youthful appearance | Is a source of skin-irritating tannins,"Carica papaya leaf extract is a natural, antioxidant-rich plant extract that contains flavonoids, saponins, alkaloids, tannins, and glycosides. It’s a documented potent antioxidant that can assist in the fight against pro-aging environmental stressors. Although from the same plant, this ingredient differs greatly from papaya fruit extract as the leaf doesn’t contain the exfoliating enzyme (papain) or vitamin C. Research has shown Carica papaya leaf extract contains caffeic acid and rutin, both powerful and potent antioxidants. When paired with the plant extract’s other antioxidant flavonoid compounds, they work to curb the effects of aggressive aging external agents, keeping skin looking youthful and even. Although Carica papaya leaf extract doesn’t contain the potent skin-sensitizing enzyme papain that papaya fruit extract contains, it does contain tannins, which are antioxidant compounds that can potentially irritate the skin."
Carmine,Average,,"Coloring Agent/Pigment, Plant Extracts",,"Natural red color that comes from the dried female cochineal beetle. It is sometimes used to color lip gloss, lipsticks, and other cosmetics. The FDA approved carmine for food use in 19"

This ingredient is most popular in hair care (including hair dyes) where it provides conditioning properties as well as anti-frizz, anti-static, and detangling benefits. It may be plant- or animal-derived or synthetic. Cetrimonium chloride can also be used as part of cosmetic preservative blends and may be used to inhibit unwanted odors from forming within a formula. It is a colorless to pale yellow liquid in raw material form. The 2012 Cosmetic Ingredient Review report deemed cetrimonium chloride safe in amounts up to 10% when used in rinse-off formulas. Studies indicate lower amounts (no greater than 1%) are recommended for leave-on products to avoid irritancy, with some research suggesting 0.25% should be the maximum to avoid sensitization."

If the parthenolide is removed, it is not a problem for skin and may actually be beneficial. Parthenolide-free Chrysanthemum parthenium extract offers potent skin-soothing properties and can help to diminish redness. If a skin care product contains chrysanthemum parthenium extract, it’s best to contact the company to confirm that the their product is parthenolide-free."
Citrus Unshiu,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Antioxidant",,"Citrus unshiu is a plant extract more commonly known as the satsuma. This medium-sized citrus fruit is native to Japan. Like all citrus extracts, it contains volatile fragrance chemicals that can be a source of skin aggravation. Of course, it has antioxidant ability as do most plants, but ideally you should be seeking antioxidants that provide benefits rather than a mix of benefits and risks."
Citrus Unshiu Peel Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Antioxidant",,"Citrus unshiu peel extract is a plant extract more commonly known as the satsuma. This medium-sized citrus fruit is native to Japan. Like all citrus extracts, it contains volatile fragrance chemicals that can be a source of skin aggravation.

Clary Sage,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Also known as Salvia sclarea, the extract from the clary sage plant (not to be confused with common sage leaf) has antioxidant properties, although it isn't nearly as well researched as several other plant extracts with antioxidant benefits. Note that the oil form of clary sage can be a skin sensitizer and should be avoided. The main antioxidants in clary extract come from the seeds, and include vitamin E, lutein, and various carotenoids.  Clary extract and its derivatives have generally recognized as safe status, including for use in foods."
Cola Acuminata Seed Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Irritant",,"Cola acuminata seed extract is also known as kola nut. One of the major components of this extract is caffeine, which in high amounts can be a skin sensitizer."
Copaifera Officinalis,Average,,"Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Irritant, Plant Extracts","Type of flowering plant native to South America | Can have emollient, antimicrobial, and anti-inflammatory properties | Long used in traditional medicine | Used in wound healing in clinical settings | Contains volatiles terpenoids that can irritate skin","Copaifera officinalis is a type of flowering plant, also known as the copaifera balsam, that’s native to areas in South America, including Venezuela, Brazil, and Bolivia. Long used in traditional medicine, research is finding that it has value for its ability to soothe inflammation and fight off microbes. This makes it valuable for wound healing in clinical settings, but not for daily skin care. As with most plants, which part of Copaifera officinalis is used has a big impact on how it affects the body. Some parts of its leaves and oil have emollient and healing properties. However, its oleoresins, which are obtained when the plant components are treated with a type of solvent, contain volatile terpenoids that can irritate skin. Knowing which part of the plant is being used in the skin care product you’re using can make a big difference!"
Copper Sulfate,Average,,Irritant,,"Effective for soothing skin, but there is no research showing it has any impact when used in skin Copper Sulfatecare products."
Coriander,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural, Antioxidant",,"Herb and spice plant, the source of a fragrant component; it can aggravate skin. Newer research has shown that coriander leaf extract has restorative benefit, which is likely due to coriander leaf being a rich source of linolenic acid. It also appears coriander offers antioxidant benefit, at least when consumed orally. Last, components in coriander oil have skin-soothing benefits, but that doesn’t mean its fragrance components aren’t cause for concern."
Cranberry Seed Extract,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Exfoliant",Natural extract from cranberry seeds | Contains skin-beneficial antioxidants | May be used as exfoliating scrub particles | Also goes by Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry) seed,"Cranberry seed extract is a natural skin care ingredient obtained from the seeds of cranberries. Cranberry seeds are known for their potent antioxidants. The North American species of cranberries used in cosmetics goes by the INCI name Vaccinium macrocarpon (cranberry) seed. Cranberry seeds can be used as exfoliating scrub particles. If not smoothly, finely milled, the abrasive nature of the irregularly shaped particles can be harsh on skin, leading to barrier disruption/impairment. Using cranberry seed in this form is not best practice in modern day cosmetics (there are gentler, more effective forms of exfoliating ingredients available, such as jojoba beads). Occasionally brands used the terms cranberry seed extract and cranberry seed oil interchangeably—although they carry different implications. The seed oil form is highly favored in skin care research thanks to its soothing, moisturizing properties in addition to providing beneficial omega fatty acids and antioxidants to skin. See our Ingredient Dictionary entry for Vaccinium macrocarpon (Cranberry) Seed Oil for more info. Cranberry seed extract and other cranberry-derived cosmetic ingredients have the potential to be upcycled as byproducts from the agricultural industry. Upcycling helps divert waste and reduce environmental impact by utilizing portions of the plant that would otherwise be discarded."

D&C Colors,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,General term for a wide group of color additives that are approved for use in drugs and cosmetics but not in foods (foods may only be colored with FD&C-approved dyes). Many red dyes fall into this category due to concern about oral consumption.
Dehydroepiandrosterone,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",,Dehydroepiandrosterone is a naturally-occurring hormone also called DHAE.
Deuterium Oxide,Average,,Solvent,,"Deuterium oxide is a form of water also known as “heavy water” that, due to its chemical composition, has a higher mass than regular water."
Dibutyl Phthalate,Average,,"Solvent, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural",,"Also known as DBP, it is a common ingredient in nail polish and most synthetic fragrances sold today. It is used as a plasticizer, fragrance stabilizer, and is a key component in giving nail polish its unique properties. The most common mode of exposure, though, is through foods that come into contact with PVC (polyvinylchloride) plastic packaging. Phthalates are also found in countless other products, including building materials, insecticides, nutritional supplements, children’s toys, and automobiles. In short, it is impossible to completely avoid exposure to phthalates. Dibutyl phthalate (DBP) became controversial when The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published the National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals - Results for Mono-butyl phthalate [which is] (metabolized from dibutyl phthalate). The report noted that measurable levels of phthalate were found in the urine of the participants in the study. However, the CDC also stated that “Finding a measurable amount of one or more phthalate metabolites in urine does not mean that the level of one or more phthalates causes an adverse health effect. Whether phthalates at the levels of metabolites reported here are a cause for health concern is not yet known; more research is needed.” Despite the negative association phthalate exposure has in animals, an analysis of multiple studies and epidemiologic research led to the conclusion that “...the risks are low, even lower than originally thought, and that there is no convincing evidence of adverse effects on humans. Since the scientific evidence strongly suggests that risks to humans are low, phthalate regulations that have been enacted are unlikely to lead to any marked improvement in public health.”"
Diethylhexyl Succinate,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Solvent, Texture Enhancer",Diester of 2-ethylhexyl alcohol and succinic acid | A well-known texture enhancer that works to keep formulas smooth | Has emollient and skin conditioning properties | Also known as bis(2-ethylhexyl) succinate,"Diethylhexyl succinate is a colorless, odorless emollient diester texture enhancer that’s produced from naturally occurring fatty acid succinic acid and 2-ethylhexyl alcohol. It’s also often referred to as bis(2-ethylhexyl) succinate. Despite its natural origin, the finished ingredient is considered synthetic. In skin care and personal care formulations, diethylhexyl succinate imparts texture-enhancing and solvent properties that greatly benefit the feel of products. Soluble in oil, water and oil/alcohol mixtures, this diester also has emollient properties, softening skin as it helps keep moisture from escaping. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Panel has deemed diethylhexyl succinate as safe for usage in cosmetics in amounts up to 6%."
Dilinoleic Acid Propanediol Copolymer,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Emollient, Film-Forming Agent, Polymer, Texture Enhancer","Emollient, film-former, and viscosity increasing agent | Often used in lip products where it lends a glossy effect + hydrating emollience | May also contribute long wear properties in sunscreen products | Slightly yellow, pourable, odorless liquid in raw material form","Dilinoleic acid/propanediol copolymer’s reported cosmetics functions include emollient, film-former, and viscosity increasing agent (texture enhancer). Top uses of this ingredient fall mostly into the realm of makeup, specifically lip products where it can lend a glossy effect + emollience. It plays well in lipsticks, lip balms and other lip formulations due to its solubility in common-to-lip-product ingredients such as castor oil and esters. Dilinoleic acid/propanediol copolymer is also said to contribute to long wear properties in sunscreen products, due its insolubility in water and alcohol. Officially, the Personal Care Products Council classifies dilinoleic acid/propanediol copolymer as a synthetic ingredient; however, suppliers note it can be vegetable-derived. As a raw material, it is a slightly yellow, pourable, odorless liquid. At the time of this writing, independent research on this ingredient is lacking. Although we could not find a Cosmetic Ingredient Review assessment for dilinoleic acid/propanediol copolymer, there is no suspected reason to be concerned about its safety. Supplier RIPT testing (a type of testing where the ingredient is applied to skin and monitored for irritancy effects) revealed favorable results. Standard usage levels range from 1–5% depending on formulary needs"
Dioscorea Villosa Extract,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Plant Extracts, Humectant",,Dioscorea villosa extract is taken from the wild yam. It can have humectant (moisturizing) properties for skin.
Diosmine,Average,,Antioxidant,Antioxidant that is rarely used in cosmetic formulations | Research on this ingredient’s impact on skin is lacking at the time of this writing | Used in supplement/medical fields,"Diosmine is an antioxidant that is rarely used in cosmetic formulations. While in theory it should function like other beneficial antioxidants for skin, independent research on this ingredient’s impact on skin is lacking at the time of this writing. Diosmine is also used in the supplement and medical fields."
Diospyros Kaki Fruit Extract,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Antioxidant, Plant Extracts","Also known as Japanese persimmon fruit extract | Helps protect skin from environmental stressors that can lead to signs of aging | Contains flavonoids and carotenoids, both antioxidant compounds | Raw persimmon fruit extract has shown evidence of vitamins A and C | Contains tannins, strong antioxidants with potential skin-sensitizing effects","Diospyros kaki fruit extract is a yellow-orange plant extract derived from the fruit of the Japanese persimmon. A rich source of antioxidants, this extract helps to mitigate damage brought on by environmental aggressors, like sun and pollution. This fruit extract’s antioxidant properties come from its high content of phenolic compounds, vitamins A and C, and carotenoids, all of which serve to help protect skin, keeping it looking younger and healthy. However, Diospyros kaki fruit extract also features astringent tannins when not fully ripened. Tannins are strong antioxidants that also contain certain tannin compounds that work to denature proteins that help keep skin healthy. Recent studies have discovered new procedures to reduce the tannin content in Diospyros kaki fruit, including freezing; however, at this point it’s unknown if the form used in cosmetics contains these tannins or not. You would need to contact the company which produces the product to find out if they took steps to remove them from formulations. Due to its high antioxidant content, Diospyros kaki fruit extract is susceptible to light and heat degradation and should be housed in light and airproof packaging, away from windows or particularly warm areas."
Dipeptide Diaminobutyroyl Benzylamide Diacetate,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Peptides",Considered a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide | Also goes by the tradename SYN®-AKE | Touted as mimicking the activity of snake venom to paralyze muscles that induce wrinkles | More independent studies are needed to validate potential benefits,"Dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzylamide diacetate is considered a neurotransmitter-inhibiting peptide, meaning it could have the ability to target expression lines. It also goes by the tradename SYN®-AKE, which nods to the manufacturer’s origin stories of its ability to “mimic the activity of snake venom toxin Waglerin 1.” This is extolled to paralyze muscle contraction related to wrinkles, similar to what injectable procedures can offer—however, it’s important to note that these claims are overexaggerated. While the research regarding dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzylamide diacetate is alluring, the issue is that these studies are tied back to companies with a financial interest in profiting from this ingredient, so we don’t have reliable independent research to go by at the time of this writing. Is there potential for this ingredient to help minimize expression lines? Possibly, but further independent studies are necessary to validate these findings. Suppliers of dipeptide diaminobutyroyl benzylamide diacetate note that it comes as a white powder in its raw material form. Manufacturers also classify this ingredient as a skin-conditioning agent. Usage levels range from 0.005%–1%."
Disodium Phosphate,Average,,pH Adjuster/Stabilizer,"“Behind-the-scenes” ingredient commonly used as a buffering agent/pH adjuster | Also helps prevent the rusting of metallic materials used in cosmetic packaging | Odorless, yet it can help intensify other fragrance/flavor ingredients Hygroscopic powder (meaning it will absorb moisture from air upon exposure)","Disodium phosphate is a “behind-the-scenes” ingredient that is most commonly used as a buffering agent/pH adjuster in skin care and other cosmetic formulations. It also functions as a corrosion inhibitor to prevent the rusting of metals used in packaging. As a raw material, disodium phosphate is a hygroscopic powder (meaning it will absorb moisture from air upon exposure but just how much is dependent on the humidity and temperature). Technically it is not a fragrance ingredient (it is odorless in and of itself) yet it can help intensify other fragrance/flavor ingredients if present in a formula. The 2021 Cosmetic Ingredient Review of disodium phosphate surveyed 280 products containing 0.000054-2.9% of this ingredient, where it was deemed, “safe in the present practices of use and concentration in cosmetics as described in this safety assessment, when formulated to be nonirritating.” In another nod to this ingredient’s safety, the U.S. FDA has determined that it is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) as a direct food additive."
Distearyldimonium Chloride,Average,,"Cleansing Agent, Emulsifier",Cationic surfactant that helps cleanse skin | Assists in stabilizing O/W emulsions | Often used in skin and hair care preparations | Can impart a smooth feel upon skin,"Distearyldimonium chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt and cationic surfactant skin care ingredient used in products as a cleansing and emulsion stabilizing agent. This multi-tasking ingredient can be created synthetically or be derived naturally. Cationic surfactants like distearyldimonium chloride differ from other groups of surfactants in that the end of their water-attracted (hydrophilic) tail possesses an ion that holds a positive charge. This positive charge helps cationic surfactants cleanse away microorganisms on skin’s surface. Beyond cleansing, distearyldimonium chloride also helps stabilize oil-in-water emulsions so that the oil and water-based phases do not separate in their packaging when we attempt to apply them to the face and body. It’s popular as an emulsifying agent in lotions, where it’s said to also impart a smooth feel upon skin. Outside of skin care, this ingredient is also used in hair care as an anti-static and conditioning ingredient. As a raw material, distearyldimonium chloride appears as a white, off-white or light-yellow color and can be produced in powder or pellet form. Suppliers recommend using distearyldimonium chloride in percentages ranging from 0.5 to 10%. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel has yet to review this ingredient."
Elastin,Average,,Humectant,"One thing to keep in mind: Unlike collagen, it’s much harder to stimulate the regeneration of elastin within the extracellular matrix (area of skin between the epidermis and dermis). That’s why it’s important to maintain the health of the elastin already present in skin through the consistent usage of sun safe practices, such as the application of a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every day.","Elastin is a fibrous protein that naturally occurs in the connective tissue in humans and animals. More specifically in skin, elastin makes up 2-4% of the dermis and allows skin to “bounce back” like a rubber band after stretching. As elastin breaks down, you begin to see signs of sagging skin. As a skin care ingredient, elastin is sourced from farm animals such as cattle or goats, commonly extracted from the animal’s aorta or vertebrae. The elastin is treated, processed, and purified yielding a pale-yellow raw material that is practically insoluble and difficult to formulate with. It cannot function like elastin does within the body, as its molecules are far too large to penetrate beyond skin’s surface when applied topically. The Personal Care Products Council categorizes elastin as a skin-conditioning/hair-conditioning ingredient with slight humectant properties. Some cosmetic suppliers also cite snail secretion filtrate (snail mucin) as a source of elastin. While it’s true snail secretion filtrate contains components of elastin, don’t expect miracles as it cannot shore up or function like the elastin in skin. As of 2022, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel deemed elastin safe as a cosmetic ingredient, but they did not provide data on recommended usage levels as concentrations were not reported. One thing to keep in mind: Unlike collagen, it’s much harder to stimulate the regeneration of elastin within the extracellular matrix (area of skin between the epidermis and dermis). That’s why it’s important to maintain the health of the elastin already present in skin through the consistent usage of sun safe practices, such as the application of a broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen every day."
Equisetum Arvense,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Plant extract that has antioxidant and soothing properties, but there’s no solid research showing it can exert these effects when applied to skin. May also be listed by its common name horsetail extract."
Ethyl Hexanediol,Average,,"Solvent, Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural",,"A synthetic, viscous alcohol that functions as a solvent and can also be a fragrance ingredient. Considered safe for use in cosmetics in concentrations up to 5%. Ethyl hexanediol is most commonly used in haircare products and cleansers. Interestingly, higher amounts of this ingredients are sometimes used as an insect repellant."
Euphrasia Officinalis,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Irritant",,"Euphrasia officinalis is a plant extract also known as eyebright. Although the name sounds like it would be beneficial for the eye area, there are no studies demonstrating it has any benefit for the skin around the eye area. Health benefits of eyebright are largely anecdotal, though it’s possible this plant’s tannin content could aggravate skin."
Ext. D&C,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,"Type of coloring agent. According to the FDA’s website (www.fda.gov), when” Ext. D&C” is followed by a color, it means that the color is certified as safe for use only in drugs and cosmetics meant for external use, but not around the eyes or mouth. These types of coloring agents is not safe for foods."
Eyebright,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Irritant, Humectant",,"A plant; although the name sounds like it would be beneficial for the eye area, there are no studies demonstrating it has any benefit for the skin around the eye area. Health benefits of eyebright are largely anecdotal, though it’s possible this plant’s tannin content could aggravate skin."
FD&C,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,"Type of coloring agent. According to the FDA, when FD&C is followed by a color, the color is certified as safe for use in food, drugs, and cosmetics."
FD&C Colors,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,"General term for any color additive deemed safe and FDA-approved for use in foods, drugs, and cosmetics. When an FD&C color is followed by the word “lake,” it means the color has been mixed with a mineral (most commonly calcium or aluminum) to make the color insoluble (not affected by water). For example, “FD&C Blue No. 1-Aluminum Lake” means that the color FD&C Blue No. 1 has been combined with aluminum. Lake colors are used for candies and for dyes used to color Easter eggs, among countless cosmetics applications. The current group of FD&C colors has been extensively studied, with many classified as “permanently approved” for use in drugs and foods. Some FD&C colors, such as Blue 1 and Blue 2, are derivatives of coal tar and can cause allergic reactions, although the amounts used in items such as lipsticks typically are lower than the amounts used for other types of coloring agents. No coal tar colors are permitted in products for use around the eyes, and every batch of coal tar color must be deemed safe before it can be used in foods, drugs, or cosmetics. Any coloring agent used in eye makeup must be specifically approved for that purpose by the FDA. The color of cosmetics products is often an emotional pull for many consumers. A soft pink lotion can denote a moisturizer meant to calm or soothe skin, while a bright yellow balm may be deemed energizing. Whether natural or synthetic, coloring agents in skincare products serve no purpose other than to create a perception or an emotional response to the product. Coloring agents used in makeup are a different story, as they’re used to create an endless kaleidoscope of shades."
Ferric Ammonium Ferrocyanide,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,"Inorganic salt of ferric ferrocyanide used as a coloring agent in cosmetics for application to skin and eye area, but not to the lips. Like all cosmetic coloring agents, this one is subject to strict regulations controlling its use."
Ferric Ferrocyanide,Average,,Coloring Agent/Pigment,,"Coloring agent, also known as Iron Blue, used in cosmetics products, including those designed for use around the eye. Permanently listed (since 1978) by the FDA as safe."
Feverfew Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Irritant",,"Feverfew extract can be potentially skin sensitizing if a specific constituent of the feverfew plant known as parthenolide (technically, sesquiterpene lactone) is present. If the parthenolide is removed from feverfew, it is not a problem for skin and may actually be beneficial because parthenolide-free feverfew has potent skin-soothing properties and can help to diminish redness. If a skin care product contains feverfew, it’s best to contact the company to confirm that the feverfew in their products is parthenolide-free. Feverfew also goes by the names Tanacetum parthenium and Chrysanthemum parthenium."
Fish Cartilage Extract,Average,,,,"May have water-binding properties, but there is no research showing that this has any benefit for skin."
Flavor,Average,,Fragrance: Synthetic and Natural,,"According to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the term “flavor” on a product label signifies “any natural or synthetic substance or substances used solely to impart a taste to a cosmetic product.” In Europe, the labeling name for flavor is “aroma”. The term “flavor” is used most often for lip-care products and lip cosmetics (think lipstick, lip gloss). Although it is basically synonymous with fragrance, listing “flavor” on products meant for application to lips is more appealing (who wants to think of ingesting fragrance?). Given that flavor can be composed of numerous ingredients, it’s a gamble as to whether or not lips will experience sensitivity. Most lip plumpers listing flavor tend to use that term to encompass flavoring agents that can have a sensitizing effect of lips, such as various types of pepper, ginger, or various forms of mint."
Fruit Acid,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Irritant",,
Gelatin,Average,,Texture Enhancer,,Protein obtained from plants or animals and used in cosmetics as a thickening agent. Its use has decreased considerably as more brands move away from formulating cosmetics with animal-derived ingredients.
Germaben II,Average,,Preservative,,Trade name for diazolidinyl urea. Trade names are not pemitted as stand-ins for the individual ingredients on a cosmetic ingredient label.
Hibiscus,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Any of numerous types of fragrant flowers that convey antioxidant ability. According to Natural Medicine’s Comprehensive Database, “The applicable part of hibiscus is the flower, calyx or sepal, leaves, stems, and seeds. Sepal extracts contain significant amounts of vitamin C, anthocyanins, and polyphenols. The sepal also contains the highest concentration of water-soluble antioxidants.” They go on to state that the seed and leaf of hibiscus also contain significant amounts of vitamin E and that hibiscus seeds contain the highest concentration of lipid soluble antioxidants. Despite the impressive research building for various types of hibiscus, it remains a fragrant plant, with some types being notably more fragrant than others. Because fragrance is a source of sensitivity, hibiscus isn’t among the top antioxidants we’d recommend you look for when shopping for skin care, though the fragrance concern is primarily when the whole plant is used rather than isolated extracts, which may be less (or minimally) fragrant."
Hibiscus Sabdariffa Fruit Extract,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Antioxidant, Humectant, Plant Extracts",Fruit from a plant commonly known as roselle | Used to make teas | Manufacturers claim it restores hydration | Part of an ingredient blend called Hydrosella,"Hibiscus sabdariffa fruit extract comes from a plant commonly called roselle. For centuries it has been used to make teas and as a food additive, as well as being used to treat a variety of internal illnesses. While there is research demonstrating the antioxidant capacity of the flowers of this plant, specifically its calyxes (a membrane of sorts covering a flower when it’s in its bud stage), there is not a wealth of information when it comes to its fruit, including what benefits, if any, it has for skin. Manufacturers of a skin care ingredient called Hydrosella, which is a combination of glycerin, water, erythritol, and Hibiscus sabdariffa fruit extract, claim it promotes skin health through hydration and preventing water loss. But keep in mind glycerin can do that on its own, so attributing this to the fruit is meaningless unless comparative research is done."
Horsetail Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Plant extract that has antioxidant and soothing properties, but there’s no solid research showing it can exert these effects when applied to skin. Horsetail may be listed by its Latin name Equisetum arvense ."
Hortonia Floribunda Leaf Extract,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Plant Extracts, Humectant",,No research shows this plant as having any benefit for skin.
Hypericum Extract,Average,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Hypericum extract is also known as St. John’s wort. It contains several components that can cause a negative reaction on skin when it is exposed to sunlight; however, this is a bigger concern when St. John’s wort is taken orally. Like most plants, it’s a rich source of antioxidants."
Hypericum Perforatum Extract,Average,,"Plant Extracts, Antioxidant, Irritant",,"Hypericum perforatum extract (also known as St. John’s Wort) is a plant that contains several components that can cause a negative reaction on skin when it is exposed to sunlight. However, this is a bigger concern when taken orally. Like most plants, it’s a rich source of antioxidants."
Hypericum Perforatum Flower/Leaf/Stem Extract,Average,"Hydration, Anti-Aging","Hydration, Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,"Hypericum perforatum flower/leaf/stem extract (also known as St. John’s wort) is a plant that contains several components that can cause a negative reaction on skin when it is exposed to sunlight. However, this is a bigger concern when taken orally. Like most plants, it’s a rich source of antioxidants."
Incidentals,Average,,"Solvent, Suspending/Dispersing Agent, Texture Enhancer",Refers to ingredients with no measurable effect in a cosmetic or on skin | The lack of efficacy is almost always due to the amount being vanishingly low | Preservatives and de-foaming agents fall into this category | May also refer to ingredients added during processing that do not end up in finished good,"Incidental ingredients are defined by the FDA as “any ingredient of another ingredient or processing aid present at an insignificant level and having no technical or functional effect.” Preservatives, defoamers, stabilizers, and other similar ingredients that are part of another ingredient, blend, or used as a processing aid are examples of incidental ingredients. They are considered incidental because they are present in such vanishingly low amounts in the final product that they have no technical or functional effect in the formula or on skin. What is the difference between a regular ingredient in your personal care formulas versus an incidental ingredient? Incidental ingredients do not have any impact on the product’s performance, aesthetics, or safety. In the United States and many other countries, it is not a requirement to declare incidental ingredients on a cosmetic’s ingredient list since they have no impact on the product itself or how it may interact with skin. However, some brands opt to include them. In contrast, regular, non-incidental ingredients can and do have a wide range of effects in a formula and on skin. These non-incidental ingredients are required to be disclosed via standardized ingredient lists, as they serve an intended purpose to provide benefits to skin and its appearance and/or to stabilize a formula so it remains intact, stable and safe to use."
Isobutane,Average,,,"Colorless, odorless gas | Used as a propellant for aerosol cans | Considered nontoxic as used in cosmetics | Has Generally Recognized As Safe status as a food ingredient","Isobutane is a colorless and odorless gas used as a propellant for aerosol cans (think spray sunscreens and hairspray). It occurs in small amounts in petroleum and natural gas but is produced in a refinery process that removes contaminants. Isobutane is considered nontoxic as used in cosmetics, where it is included at levels far below those deemed unsafe. In addition to its use as an aerosol propellant, isobutane is also commonly employed as a refrigerant, and is even considered a Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) food ingredient such as for whipped toppings used on desserts."
Isocetyl Salicylate,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant",,Isocetyl salicylate is a derivative of salicylic acid that has hydrating properties for skin.
Isomalt,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant, Texture Enhancer",Polysaccharide that works as a humectant | Helps maintain water content in cosmetic and skin care formulas | In its raw form appears as a white crystalline substance | Often used in food applications,"Isomalt is a plant-derived white crystalline polysaccharide that works as a humectant when used in skin care formulas. It’s great at retaining moisture and is commonly included in cosmetics and skin care products to help keep the water present in formulas from evaporating. Food grade isomalt is a common sugar substitute used in the creation of edible items like various candies, protein powders and fruit preserves The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Panel found that isomalt is safe and non-irritating for use as currently used in cosmetics. It’s most often used as part of a blend with various plant extracts and the fatty acid lecithin. Amounts tested went as high as 50%, although much lower amounts of isomalt are used in cosmetics."
Isopropyl Lauroyl Sarcosinate,Average,,Emollient,Functions as an emollient | Also helps dissolve ingredients that are not readily soluble | Derived from amino acids | Suggested usage amounts in cosmetics range from 2-10%,"Isopropyl lauroyl sarconsinate is a rarely used cosmetic ingredient that functions as an emollient. It also helps dissolve ingredients – including some organic UV filters – that are not readily soluble. Isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate is derived from amino acids. There isn’t a large body of research regarding its safety. There are some reports of allergic contact dermatitis from products containing isopropyl lauroyl sarcosinate, though it hasn’t been clearly determined if this ingredient by itself caused those reactions, or if other factors were at issue. Suggested usage amounts for isoproyl lauroyl sarcosinate in cosmetics range from 2-10%."
Juglans Regia (Walnut) Shell Extract,Average,Anti-Aging,"Anti-Aging, Plant Extracts, Antioxidant",,Extract that can have antioxidant properties for skin.

Magnesium Gluconate,Average,Hydration,"Hydration, Humectant","Magnesium salt of gluconic acid | Offers skin-conditioning benefits | Can help improve a smooth skin appearance | Outside of skin care, it’s used as a supplement","Magnesium gluconate, the magnesium salt of gluconic acid, is a skin-conditioning ingredient. Despite its mineral origin, it’s considered a synthetic ingredient. Skin-conditioning ingredients work overtime to help improve the appearance of skin, increasing smoothness and reducing flakiness, roughness and a dry texture. Outside of cosmetics, magnesium gluconate is used as a supplement for those who need more magnesium. Currently, there’s not enough peer-reviewed research to support further skin benefits of magnesium gluconate. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel hasn’t yet reviewed this ingredient. It may play a role in improving barrier health by making magnesium more bioavailable to skin, and the gluconic acid salt has light humectant properties."
Malvaceae Extract,Average,,Plant Extracts,,"Extract from plants of the Malvaceae family, which includes over 1,000 species, found in tropical and temperate regions the world over. Their varying benefits and problems are diverse. Consequently, if “Malvaceae” is present on a cosmetic ingredient label, it is misleading, because each of the 1,000 species has its own pros and cons."
Manganese Gluconate,Average,"Anti-Aging, Hydration","Anti-Aging, Hydration, Humectant, Antioxidant",,"Mineral found in trace amounts in tissues of the body. While manganese plays a vital role in the processes of many body systems, there is no evidence it serves any purpose topically on skin, though it may act as an antioxidant."
